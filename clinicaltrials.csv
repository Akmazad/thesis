Its high rate of spread and infection in the human population and the lack of effective and validated treatment have led the authorities of several countries to confine their populations to slow the spread of COVID-19. As part of the management of this health crisis, the screening of individuals is essential in order to isolate \"infected cases\". These screening tests are currently performed on nasopharyngeal swabs using RT-PCR for the detection of viral RNA. Although sensitive and specific, these tests remain relatively long (2-5 hours), expensive and the strong international demand for nucleic extraction kits and enzymes are factors limiting the implementation of widespread screening (problem of supply of swabs, molecular biology consumables).\n\nIn order to prevent the risks of a shortage of screening means, we propose to develop an innovative alternative strategy, PCR-free, based on the detection of specific protein signatures in human saliva by MALDI-TOF MS profiling. MALDI-TOF MS profiling is a method used in routine diagnostics by microbiology laboratories for the identification of microorganisms. MALDI-TOF MS profiling has been successfully used to classify individuals according to their infectious status (oral pathologies) based on the analysis of their saliva, but also as a tool for the identification of respiratory viruses from cell culture supernatants. In addition, we have expertise and skills in the field of MALDI-TOF MS profiling and have implemented new strategies to improve the quality of profiles and their analysis, particularly in the context of entomological and vector identification projects. Finally, recent Chinese studies have reported that COVID-19 was detectable in saliva by RT-PCR.\n\nThe main objective of this study is to develop a test based on the MALDI-TOF profiling method to detect individuals infected with SARS-CoV2 from saliva sample.",

These ulcers, or sores, if left untreated can increase the chance of amputation. Part of the treatment is to have the person wear a diabetic shoe or boot to help their foot heal. Sometimes people don't wear the boot like they are told. We want to compare three different kinds of diabetic boots to see if we can help make it easier for people to wear their boots as instructed.\n\nWe will look at three groups: the first group will wear a boot that can't be taken off. The second group will wear a boot that can be taken off, and they will get counseling about how important it is to follow instructions as to how often and when to wear the boot. The third group will wear a \"smart\" boot, which will interact with the person through a smartwatch and smartphone, and give them direct feedback about how they are doing with following their boot wearing prescription.\n\nWe also will be looking at how much physical activity, like walking, people do. And we will compare how well people sleep and rate their quality of life in the three different boots. We think that giving people information about how much they are wearing their boot using readily available technology will help them to follow the doctor's directions better, and help their wounds heal faster.", 
"Hepatorenal syndrome-acute kidney injury (HRS-AKI), a potentially reversible renal failure, is a serious, rapidly progressing, often fatal, complication of decompensated cirrhosis. Terlipressin is a synthetic vasopressin analogue that acts as a systemic vasoconstrictor via the vascular vasopressin V1 receptors. In HRS-AKI patients the strong V1 receptor-mediated vasoconstrictor activity of terlipressin, particularly in the splanchnic area, increases effective intravascular volume and mean arterial pressure (MAP), ameliorates renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity, and improves renal blood flow. The INFUSE trial will evaluate the use of continuous terlipressin infusion in patients on the liver transplant waiting list with HRS-AKI.",

"The objective of this study is to look for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the semen of patients diagnosed with COVID+ based on RT-PCR analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs.", "Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common nerve compression syndrome worldwide, causing significant chronic pain, functional impairment, and lowered quality of life for individuals of various backgrounds. CTS is caused by chronic compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel of the wrist, causing numbness and pain in the palm, thumb, index, and middle fingers and eventual weakness of the hand. Many different treatments for CTS have been proposed and studied, including but not limited to non-operative treatments such as wrist splinting, steroid injections, and lifestyle modifications as well as operative treatments, such as surgical carpal tunnel release (CTR). To date, very few oral medications have been shown to be effective as conservative treatments for CTS. In this study the investigators will examine whether there is any benefit to using oral N-acetylcysteine (NAC) as an adjunctive treatment for mild to moderate CTS in addition to a standard 8-week trial of night splinting. NAC has been used in humans for various purposes, is extremely safe and has very few side effects, and has been shown to have anti-inflammation properties which may help treat CTS. The investigators will study this by performing a randomized controlled trial, comparing patients receiving oral NAC and standard night splinting to patients receiving an identical placebo and standard night splinting. Both patient groups will be assessed using a questionnaire to assess for severity of their CTS symptoms both before and after the 8-week treatment. The primary objective will be to determine whether supplementation with oral NAC in addition to night splinting has any significant impact on patient-reported symptoms and functional impairment when compared to night splinting alone. The investigators will also measure secondary outcomes including whether patients decide to have surgery for their CTS after treatment and/or continued use of other treatments. This study has the potential to have a significant positive impact on patients by identifying a safe, inexpensive, accessible, and well tolerated conservative treatment for mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome, and potentially preventing the need for additional, more invasive treatments such as surgery.",

As BC is a clinically and biologically heterogeneous disease, intrincsic subtype may play an important role in classifying patients. In this case, HER2-E subtype is present in approximately 6.6-11.0% of HR+/HER2-negative tumors and might express either HER2, estrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR), we also know that HER2-E is present twice as much in metastatic tumors compared to primary tumors and that HER2-E patients may benefit in terms of PFS form an anti-HER2 drug as was showed using retrospective sample in EGF30008 trial. Therefore, incorporation of novel drugs in combination with endocrine therapy (ET) can improve patient outcomes in HR+/HER2-negative BC advanced disease specially in those with HER2-E subtype.\n\nMethods NEREA is an open-label, single arm, multicenter phase II study evaluating treatment with neratinib in combination with ET in pre and post-menopausal women and men with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-enriched (HER2-E), HR+/HER2-negative breast cancer who had recurrence or progression while receiving previous ET (either aromatase inhibitors, tamoxifen or fulvestrant) in the adjuvant setting or to treat advanced disease or both.

The primary objective will is assess the efficacy of neratinib in combination with ET is this group of patients, efficacy will be measured as Progression-Free Survival at 6 months (PFS6) defined as the proportion of patients alive and without progression, locally assessed by the investigator through the use of RECIST v.1.1 at 24 weeks after first treatment administration, imaging evaluation will be performed every 8 weeks for the first 12 months following treatment start, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Secondary endpoints include Clinical Benefit Rate at 6 months , Overall Response rate, Duration of response, Time to response and Incidence, duration and severity of Adverse Events. The interim analysis will be conducted when 33 patients are evaluable for the primary endpoint having the potential for at least 3 'on treatment' disease assessment scans. If less than 15 patients achieved a PFS6, the trial will be terminated for futility in favor of the null hypothesis. If more than 28 patients achieved a PFS6, the trial will be stopped in favor of the alternative hypothesis demonstrating activity. If none of the two above-mentioned conditions are attain, up to a further 23 patients may be evaluated, for at least a total of 56 evaluable patients.

"Functional constipation is one of the five most common gastrointestinal diseases in outpatient visits. It is known that the global prevalence of chronic constipation is estimated to be 14%, and the prevalence of adults in my country is about 4.0% to 10.0%. It is generally believed that the diagnosis of functional constipation is based on a thorough history and physical examination. However, these standards are mainly used in clinical research and are not always strictly applicable to clinical practice. Therefore, in addition to the main symptoms, the medical history should include evidence of organic diseases (alarm symptoms). Rectal bleeding, anemia, weight loss, fever, family history of colon cancer and the age of onset over 50 years are considered as alarm symptoms of severe gastrointestinal diseases, but the value of alarm symptoms in distinguishing organic diseases from functional diseases is still not Ok, further research is still needed. In 2016, the Rome IV standard was updated and released, with some updates in the definition and diagnostic criteria for functional constipation. However, there are few studies on the clinical practice based on Rome IV. The advantages and disadvantages of adjusting the diagnostic criteria of Rome IV compared to Rome III in clinical application are still unclear. In order to evaluate the predictive value of the alarm symptoms of functional constipation based on Roman IV, we designed this cross-sectional study. It is used to evaluate the predictive value of alarm symptoms for functional constipation and organic bowel disease, as well as the predictive value of alarm symptoms of benign and malignant intestinal diseases related to functional constipation symptoms.",

"Hyperglycemia affects 30-40% of hospitalized patients. Despite the fact that basal/bolus insulin therapy has been demonstrated to improve glycemic control and clinical outcomes in patients, achieving good glucose control remains a challenge.\n\nThis study examines the effects of Fiasp (a faster acting insulin) on blood sugars after meals compared to another type of insulin known as Novolog. The study will be performed in patients with type 2 diabetes admitted to the hospital, who are not in the intensive care unit, and who are being seen by the inpatient diabetes consult team. Eligible participants will be treated with Fiasp or Novolog injected multiple times a day before meals and at bedtime, in addition to a once daily injection of insulin glargine as basal insulin. Which type of meal time insulin (Fiasp vs Novolog) the subject gets is decided by chance, like the flip of a coin. Insulin doses will be started and titrated based on a protocol. All the subjects will wear a blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)) sensor placed in their arm which they will wear for 72 hours during the study. The glucose values from the CGM, collected during the time it is worn, will be downloaded and compared to assess the response to the two different types of insulins - Fiasp and Novolog. The goal is to determine if Fiasp works as well as or better than Novolog in controlling blood sugars, particularly after meals, in the subjects of the study.",

"Infants and young children have high nutritional demands in order to support adequate growth and development, particularly during the transition from complementary feeding at 12 months of age to a mixed and varied diet at 36 months of age. Omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 LC-PUFA) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) is the important constituents of the maturing brain, especially for visual and cognitive development. However only certain foods, such as fatty fish, contain n-3 LC-PUFA at concentrations sufficient for their needs. Additionally, these foods that are known to be rich in DHA may not be regularly provided to infants and toddlers due to concerns about potential food allergies or methylmercury exposure.\n\nAlthough the importance of consuming n-3 LC-PUFA and essential fatty acids at the level of dietary recommendations in late infancy and early childhood (6-24 months) are highlighted, the current median n-3 LC-PUFA and estimated DHA intakes in toddlers in most countries are lower than the recommended levels. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommend that infants and young children (< 24 months) should consume 100 mg of DHA per day, while for older children (2-18 years), they recommend a daily intake of 250 mg. In order to bridge the gap between the current intake and recommended levels of n-3 LC-PUFA, general foods, especially infant and toddler formulas, should be enriched with n-3 LC-PUFA particularly DHA. With a growing body of research, the challenge is to find an ideal formula that is nutritionally balanced and human milk-like, especially with respect to the ratio between omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids and DHA level.\n\nIn adding DHA into the toddler formula, there are several methods, among others are in the form of wet mix and dry blending. The aim of this study is to compare the bioavailability of different methods of adding DHA (dry blend versus wet mix) into formulas in healthy Indonesian toddlers age 2-3 years old for a period of one month. Furthermore, to evaluate the stability of milk-based formulas that are supplemented with DHA under same storage conditions, so as to monitor the stability of infant formula.",

This strategy consisted in conjugated 13-valent pneumococcal injection followed 2 months later by polysaccharide 23-valent vaccine injection. General practitioners are usually in charge of this vaccination. Conjugated pneumococcal vaccine enhances the immunogenicity of the polysaccharide vaccine. Acute leukemia and lymphoma are treated with multiple courses of chemotherapy, impairing the immune system and potentially the response to vaccination. These patients are more at risk for developing pneumococcal invasive diseases than the general population. However, efficacy of pneumococcal vaccination is poorly documented in this setting. We assume that 70% of the patients are non-responders to vaccination, according to their anti-pneumococcal immunoglobulin G titers and the opsonophagocytic activity. To assess the immunogenicity of the pneumococcal vaccination combined strategy in adult population of acute leukemia and lymphoma, the investigator will measure anti-pneumococcal serotype-specific immunoglobulin G titers and opsonophagocytic activity at different time-points after completion of the combined vaccine strategy. The primary objective is to assess the immunogenicity of pneumococcal vaccination combined strategy at 3 months after the 13-valent pneumococcal injection (corresponding to 1 month after the end of the combined strategy) using immunoglobulin G titers and opsonophagocytic activity. At different time points (day 0, 1 month after the 13-valent pneumococcal injection, the day of the injection of the polysaccharide 23-valent vaccine, one month after the injection of the polysaccharide 23-valent vaccine, 3-6 months after the polysaccharide 23-valent vaccine,9-12 months after the polysaccharide 23-valent vaccine), the immunological response to vaccination will be monitored using specific-serotype immunoglobulin G titers, opsonophagocytic activity, and total anti-pneumococcal Immunoglobulin.

"Can Nanotechnology Biomarker Tagging (NBT) be used to detect COVID-19 infection in people presenting for COVID-19 testing?\n\nNBT can be used to detect the substances present in a person's breath. In this study the breath of people presenting for COVID-19 testing is going to be analysed. Analysing a large number of samples from people with COVID-19 (as confirmed by the standard swab test used by the NHS) will enable a breath profile to be produced, ie the substances present in the breath when someone has COVID-19. After the profile has been validated, NBT can be used to test whether or not a person has COVID-19 by seeing if their breath matches the profile.\n\nUsing this technology for COVID-19 testing has advantages over the current standard test. The sample can be analysed immediately in the clinical setting and the results are available in 5-10 minutes, so if the person tests negative they can go back to their normal life straight away. The current swab test takes around 72 hours for the results to be available, and the person needs to self-isolate during this time in case they test positive, resulting in potentially unnecessary days of work missed and inconvenience. The breath test is non-invasive and is unlikely to cause any discomfort, as the person is only required to breath normally into the device.

"Abstract Introduction: The high prevalence of sprains in the population has provided a substantial number of patients with lateral instability of the ankle. The continuity of this condition can lead to the progressive loosening of the medial containment structures, generating a multidirectional rotational instability. The deltoid approach through the imbrication of its components has been proposed as a solution for these patients. The arthroscopic technique has been described as an alternative.\n\nMethods: This is a retrospective study with patients diagnosed with multidirectional instability and submitted to an ankle arthroscopy with medial repair (arthroscopic tensioning) and lateral (arthroscopic Brostrom) between January 2018 and January 2020. All patients will fill an epidemiological questionnaire and will be evaluated for pain and function according to the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Score (AOFAS) at 12 months (6-24 months) average of follow-up.\n\nDiscussion: The combined medial and lateral arthroscopic repair may be an effective and safe alternative in the treatment of multidirectional instability. The inclusion of the deltoid complex and the low invasiveness of this technique can improve the clinical outcomes of these patients. Additional studies, with a prospective and comparative methodology are required to sustain this proposal.\n\nDesign: Level IV.

"Granulomatous hepatitis are histopathologically defined by the presence of epithelioid and gigantocellular granulomas within the hepatic parenchyma. Hepatic granulomas are observed in 2 to 15% of liver biopsies. Causes of granulomatous hepatitis can be related to ethnic and environmental factors and in western countries granulomatous hepatitis are mostly related to sarcoidosis and autoimmune cholangitis. Infections (mycobacteria, coxiella burnetii, hepatitis C) and medications also provide granulomatous hepatitis.\n\nSarcoidosis is a systemic disease of unknown etiology, which in third of cases has a chronic course. Five percent of patients die of their disease, mainly because of respiratory distress.

"Rationale\n\nSeveral experimental and clinical studies have shown how brain injury can cause secondary lung injury. Lung injury could be due either to mechanical ventilation- often necessary in brain injured patients- or to inflammatory response that follows primary acute brain injury. The concept of 'Protective lung ventilation' has shown to reduce morbidity and mortality of intensive care unit (ICU) patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) but seems also to have a beneficial effect on patients with healthy lungs and in the perioperative settings. However, these recommendations often come into conflict with the management of patients affected by acute brain injury, in which permissive hypercapnia and increased intrathoracic pressure as consequence of protective ventilation strategies can be dangerous.\n\nOutcomes will be assessed as:\n\n6-months mortality and neurological outcome (as for extended Glasgow Outcome Scale, eGOS),\nHospital length of stay (in days), in hospital mortality.\nMortality, duration of mechanical ventilation (in days), ventilator free days (days) at ICU discharge\n\nStudy design This is an international multi-center prospective observational study.\n\nStudy population This study will include all consecutive brain injured patients (traumatic brain injury (TBI) or cerebrovascular) intubated and ventilated in ICU and observed for a 7-day period.\n\nNature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness Seen the observational design of the study, there is no patient burden.

In the context of COVID-19 pandemic, patients with severe forms of the disease hospitalized in intensive care units (ICU) benefit from prolonged mechanical ventilation with frequent use of NMB agents. Large amount of such patient admitted in a short time has led to a shortage of NMB agents, particularly cisatracurium.\n\nThe use of NMB monitors (for example - Train of Four (TOF)) is a well-established practice in general anesthesia.

(DSM-5) describes delirium as a \"disturbance in attention (i.e., reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain, and shift attention) and awareness (reduced orientation to the environment)\". In addition, a \"disturbance in cognition (e.g., memory deficit, disorientation, language, visuospatial ability, or perception)\" occurs. The deficits cannot be explained by other neurocognitive disorders.\n\nDelirium develops within hours to a few days and can fluctuate in severity during the day. Acute delirium lasts a few hours or days, whereas persistent delirium lasts for weeks or months. In a hospital setting, delirium hardly ever lasts longer than a week but some symptoms can persist for months after the patient was discharged.\n\nAccording to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th rev. (ICD-10), delirium is a pathologic brain disorder, which consists of a disturbance in consciousness, attention, perception, memory, psychomotor functions, emotional stability, and circadian rhythm. The severity can range from mild to very severe POD occurs in connection with a surgical procedure within the first four days after an intervention. 10-70% of all surgical patients above the age of 65 years are affected.\n\nDelirium is not only a burden to the patient and their family by increasing functional and cognitive damages, and increasing mortality, it has a high impact on the economy, as well. A patient with delirium has a longer length of hospital stay, more complications, and often requires long-term care after being discharged from the hospital. All these aspects show the need for prevention of delirium.\n\nThere are various preoperative risk factors that influence the development of POD. Advanced age, preexisting cognitive impairment, depression and other psychopathologic symptoms, intake of psychotropic substances, sensory impairment like decrease in visual or auditory perception, impairment in daily life activities, dehydration, malnutrition, metabolic dysfunctions, urinary catheters, severe diseases and different comorbidities such as chronic cardiac insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, or previous history of stroke or infections favor the development of delirium.\n\nThe incidence of POD after major noncardiac surgery and the burden to patients and healthcare systems in general is high.\n\nThis research project is an observational cohort study by retrospective chart review of patients that underwent major noncardiac surgery at University Hospital Basel, Switzerland, in the years 2011-2015.

NA, "Virtually all COVID-19 RNA assays require centralized laboratories. Samples collected in locations including public testing sites, workplaces, nursing homes, and residential housing are transported to centralized laboratories for testing, leading to lengthy delays in results reporting. The window of maximal contagiousness is thought to be only a few days, so these delays create the risk of excess transmission. Current testing methods are painful, which encourages testing hesitancy. Rapid, onsite detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from non-invasive saliva could overcome these issues and provide a pathway to high-throughput detection of people at the greatest risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission but the logistics of such a testing program require real-world prototyping.\n\nThe investigators have developed a simple test to detect high concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva with assays that require no specialized equipment and can be completed in one hour. This assay is not diagnostic for SARS-CoV-2; instead, it specifically identifies saliva samples that have high amounts of viral RNA that are correlated with live virus shedding. Many samples that would be identified as SARS-CoV-2 by diagnostic qRT-PCR would be negative with this saliva assay. Conversely, positive detection of RNA in saliva is a finding of potential clinical relevance, so participants whose samples are positive will be contacted by a medical professional to discuss potential follow-up with their own health care provider, including a possible independent diagnostic testing.\n\nBecause the assay requires no specialized equipment, it can be performed at the site of sample collection using a portable laboratory that fits in the backseat of a car. The prototype testing will take place in a variety of settings that may include parking lots, workplaces, nursing homes and residential housing. Participants will be asked to consent to provide a saliva sample that will be tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels consistent with live virus shedding. The consent document will explicitly state that this is not a diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 but that a positive finding could be of clinical significance that should be discussed with a medical professional. Participants can opt-out of receiving any results at the time of consent and can provide samples for the sole purpose of contributing to community surveillance and assay development. Consent forms will be reviewed and signed and held by team members in a secure location (locked box at the collection site) until taken back to the AIDS Vaccine Research Laboratory for storage. Participants will then spit into a coded vessel (e.g., cup or tube). Samples should be at least 1ml (~¼ teaspoon) and will be assayed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the aforementioned detection assay; the presence of high concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is indicated by a colorimetric change from pink to yellow/orange.",

"For the time being, social distancing is probably the only beneficial strategy to reduce infection rates and, consequently, COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality. To date, there is no available effective treatment to avoid or reduce infection (vaccines or viral inhibitors), to reduce or eliminate viral intracellular replication (antivirals) or to mitigate the inflammatory cascade or the subsequent cytokine storm (immunomodulatory drugs) associated with high COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates although a press release of a multicenter trial showed that low-dose dexamethasone in high-risk patients was associated with a reduction in mortality.\n\nA simple strategy that can be globally implemented becomes necessary to minimize COVID-19 pandemic consequences on healthcare until an efficacious vaccine is available. Icosapent ethyl (IPE) at high doses has proven to be effective to reduce cardiovascular events in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease. In the context of COVID-19, IPE could also be useful at pre-hospital and hospital stages due to its potential anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects.\n\nHigh-level exposure and infection risk among health-care providers, as well as the fundamental need for their active role under the current pandemic, make the search for tools to reduce or avoid infection, or its clinical manifestations, a priority.\n\nWe have, therefore, designed a study with a simple, pragmatic, and universally applicable strategy with IPE at high doses intended to reduce infection and subsequent morbidity and mortality among subjects at high risk of infection due to SARS-CoV-2.", 
NA, "Intensive care units; They are units where advanced technological tools and equipment are used to provide the highest level of benefit to life-threatened patients, and physicians and nurses specializing in the treatment and care of patients are involved (Almerud et al., 2013; Intensive Care Society, 2011; Çelik , 2014; Herman et al., 2019; Özsaker et al., 2013). Intensive care patients; '' To prevent patients who are at risk due to physiological decompensation and patients who are physically physiologically fluctuating, need a treatment to be carried out with the harmony between physician and nurse to ensure survival, the application of this treatment without showing waves, especially details and care, and unexpected adverse events. and patients who require continuous monitoring to provide immediate intervention by the intensive care team '(Intensive Care Society, 2011; Circular on Standards of Intensive Care Units (2008/53); Communiqué on the Application Procedures and Principles of Intensive Care Services in TCSSYB Inpatient Health Facilities, 2011 ). Intensive care patients, as can be understood from the definition, are the patients whose general conditions change rapidly due to the presence of a life-threatening condition, due to the impact of several systems that require close monitoring and control vital functions (Chrsitopher et al., 2019; Yilmaz and Arslan, 2015). .\n\nRespiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, etc. Many conditions, such as chronic diseases, genetic, individual and environmental factors, of patients who are in danger of life due to many important health problems can affect the prognosis of the patients (Uysal et al., 2009; Çelik, 2014, McKinley et al., 2016). In addition to these factors, although there is insufficient evidence, blood groups are reported to be effective in the survival of intensive care patients (Chen et al., 2016; Franchini et al., 2007; Peyvandi et al., 2011; Song et al., 2015). Whatever the underlying situation is, the most important thing is undoubtedly the blood for the maintenance of a healthy life. It is known to affect human health in many cases, from the amount of blood circulating in the vein to the structure of blood cells (Guyton & Hall, 2007).\n\nIt was found for the first time in the years of 1899 and 1900 that human blood differs from individual to individual due to some physiological features. These different blood groups discovered are A, B and AB. Later, with the discovery of the Rh factor along with the O (zero) blood group, studies on the effects and differences of blood groups on humans have increased rapidly (Chen et al., 2016; Franchini et al., 2007; Meade et al., 1994; Spiezia et al., 2013). Today, studies on the relationship between blood groups and diseases are ongoing (Chen et al., 2016; Dogan et al., 2013; Franchini et al., 2007; Peyvandi et al., 2011; Song et al., 2015).\n\nAs a result of some studies; It has been determined that the AB blood group plays a role as a risk factor in both venous thromboembolism and coronary artery disease (Chen et al., 2016; Peyvandi et al., 2011; Song et al., 2015). The risk of both arterial and venous thrombotic events in the AB blood group There is evidence that it has high levels of vonWillebrand factor (vWF) and factor VIII (Franchini et al., 2007; Meade et al., 1994; Spiezia et al., 2013; Song et al., 2015). Depending on the limitation of mobilization in intensive care patients, it may increase the negative effect of the blood group on the patient compared to the patients hospitalized in other clinics. However, in patient groups with a high risk of bleeding, this may provide additional benefit for patients with AB blood group with higher levels of vonWillebrand factor (vWF) and factor VIII. In their research, Franchini et al. Reported that bleeding rate increased significantly in patients with O blood group, especially in surgical procedures with high risk of blood loss. Therefore, it has been observed that patients with AB blood group are more likely to survive after major heart surgery and this situation is explained in relation to the decrease in the number of blood transfusions (Franchini et al., 2016). The results of metaanalysis study of Dentali et al. Also pointed out that having an O blood group in terms of bleeding may be an important genetic factor (Dentali et al., 2013). It is important that the intensive care nurse includes this information in patient care.\n\nIn a study conducted to determine the link between ABO blood group, lipid profiles and coronary artery disease and to determine the effect size of the link, patients in the A blood group were found to have higher total cholesterol rates while lower LDL rates (Gong et al., 2015). Jiang et al; They found that ABO blood groups were not associated with age, gender, and blood pressure in stable coronary artery patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, but blood groups were associated with 2-year cardiac death (Jiang et al., 2019).\n\nAlthough it is known that genetic diversity affecting the prognosis of patients is a factor in determining survival after being taken into intensive care, it can be difficult and costly to evaluate in a short time in clinical practice (Akin & Dostbil, 2005; Dogan et al., 2013). Also, to predict the prognosis of critical patients in intensive care units today. it is still very difficult. In this context, individualized medicine; It can provide a better understanding of patients' risks arising from genetic, environmental and social factors and better planning of the results of treatment (Slade et al., 2019). At the onset of critical illness, knowing all possible risk factors to effectively manage patients creates a chance to achieve more successful treatment and care outcomes. more difficult to determine the effect on survival of genetic diversity, although there is nothing for a long time consuming and costly, ABO blood group of the survival effect according to the risk classification system, the addition of both easier, additional benefits to the patient to be quickly and cost-free by the Ministry of Health in saglayabilir.türkiye APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) is the most commonly used scale to calculate the expected mortality rate according to the severity of the disease that is approved and admitted to intensive care (Efe et al., 2018; Özban et al., 2015 Republic of Turkey Ministry of Health, Department of Health Quality, Accreditation and Employee Rights, 2017).\n\nThe relationship between patients' blood groups and mortality is thought to exist as a result of research (Slade et al., 2019). In the research of Slade et al; After the patients were admitted to the intensive care unit, the relationship between blood groups and mortality was evaluated in the 90-day period; It has been determined that patients with intensive care with AB blood group have a higher 90-day survival time compared to other blood group patients (Slade et al., 2019). In line with this result, there is a need for studies for the risk assessment scales and the addition of the blood group factor for intensive care patients.\n\nQuality nursing care is an important factor affecting the prognosis of patients. It is predicted that the application of individualized patient care will positively affect the physiological, psychological and social health of the patient (Aydin & Gürsoy, 2017). Nurses are healthcare professionals who are in key condition next to the patient in any case in intensive care units. Higher quality care of nurses at the center of many interventions in the intensive care unit has been associated with improved patient outcomes, including mortality (Anne et al., 2018; Gerth et al., 2015; Neuraz et al., 2015). In line with this information, the research was planned to determine the effect of different blood groups on the 90-day survival of intensive care patients who were treated and maintained for the first time in the intensive care unit.", 
"Infrared energy is a type of electromagnetic energy that is invisible, and is further subdivided into three subsets based on wavelength. Far infrared (FIR or IR-C) is a subset of energy in the infrared spectrum that is thought to transfer energy in the form of heat, perceived by thermoreceptors in the skin as radiant heat. FIR is thought to be both absorbed by the human body but is also emitted in the 3-50 micron range, with a peak output at 9.4 micron. The range of far infrared varies depending on which source is referenced but is generally felt to start at 3 to 5 microns. The use of FIR has been studied in various circumstances and thought to improve various biological functions via FIR heat lamps, saunas, ray devices and FIR emitting ceramics and fabrics. There are no short-term or long-term safety issues that have arisen in any studies thus far. As noted in the 2006 statement of the ICNIRP (International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection), \"…the contribution made by the IR-C spectral region (3-1,000 micron) is normally of no practical concern from a health hazard standpoint.\" FIR has been shown to increase blood flow in forearms, and access flow and survival of arteriovenous fistula in hemodialysis patients. An unpublished study, by McClue, reported an apparent increase in pedal circulation of approximately 10% using transcutaneous oxygen monitoring in healthy subjects wearing socks infiltrated with FIR emitting textiles. The mechanism of improving circulation is not entirely elucidated, however recent work suggests a role of increasing endothelial nitric oxide synthase, nitric oxide production and modulating profiles of circulating miRNAs (mircoRNA, small noncoding RNAs of ~22nt in length which are involved in the regulation of gene expression at the posttranscriptional level).\n\nType 2 Diabetes prevalence has increased significantly over the past decade, with estimates from 2015 of 26 million Americans diagnosed and predicted to increase to 32 million by 2020. Both Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes is well known to increase the risk of nontraumatic lower extremity amputation by, amongst other factors, impairing circulation to the feet through both peripheral arterial disease and microvascular dysfunction.\n\nNoninvasive transcutaneous oximetry measurements of the leg have been validated as a valuable tool in assessing lower extremity circulation in both normal subjects and diabetic individuals.\n\nThis trial seeks to prove that exposure to IR, through the use of newly developed socks that contain thermoreactive particles woven into textile, which both emit IR and reflect the IR back from the body, can augment circulation in the feet and lower legs of diabetic subjects. Noninvasive transcutaneous oximetry will be used as the assessment modality. If this study confirms this hypothesis, future studies may be planned to determine if the use of a IR-containing textile can prevent new ulcers from forming in high risk patients and perhaps even speed the healing of prevalent foot ulcers.\n\nSubjects will be recruited from both primary care and specialty medical offices who carry a diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus, will be between the ages of 18 to 80 and will act as their own controls. The goal will be to enroll a minimum of one hundred (100) patients who will be evaluated noninvasively with transcutaneous oxygen measurements using Radiometer TCM (PeriFlux 6000) supplied by Radiometer America, Inc. Upon arrival study subjects will have both feet evaluated by a registered nurse (RN), to ensure there are no signs of infection, active foot ulcers, or other open wounds. If there is any such evidence, the patients will be excluded from the trial and sent for further evaluation and treatment according to standard of care by their primary care clinicians or podiatrists. Patients will then have ankle brachial index (ABI) measurements performed on both legs to exclude those who have severe peripheral arterial disease (ABI index or 0.4 or lower).\n\nSubjects will be placed on an exam table reclined at a 120-degree angle with legs extended and supported by leg rest. The TCPO2 machine will have been turned on prior to patient arrival for calibration. If necessary, any hair on the subject's foot or leg will be removed in the area of fixation ring application by a disposable razor. The subject will then have up to 3 fixation rings attached, used for measuring TCPO2, placed on the lower leg and foot. The fixation rings will be further secured around the circumference with medical tape, approximately 1 inch by 0.5 inch per piece to further enhance the seal. The placebo sock will be placed over the foot and lower leg covering the fixation rings. The sock will then be marked at the sight of each of the fixation rings by placing a dot, with a black marker, on the sock in the center of each ring. The sock will then be taken off the subject and placed on a foot form, covering the study (IR) sock which has already been placed. Using the black mark as a guide, a vertical cut will be made through both socks, no larger than one centimeter, so that when the socks are applied, connection of the TCPO2 leads can occur while avoiding restriction or compression (known to effect O2 readings) of the electrodes. Three drops of contact solution will be placed inside each fixation ring, followed by attachment of the electrodes. There will then be a 15 minutes rest/stabilization period allowing for the TCPO2 to stabilize (stabilization phase) followed by an additional 15 minutes of readings considered the baseline levels (barefoot).\n\nThe placebo socks will then be gently applied to the feet and leg, while being careful not to disturb the fixation rings. The placebo socks are identical in all ways to the study sock, with the exception that the placebo socks do not contain the proprietary thermoreactive minerals woven into the fabric. Subjects will then wear these socks over the pre-affixed fixation rings on the study foot as well as the contralateral foot. The active phase will then commence and continue for 60 minutes, with TCPO2 measurements taking place continuously and recorded at least every 10 minutes. At the end of the 60-minute study period, the leads will be removed, followed by the socks. The fixation rings are not removed, however. The TCPO2 machine should be recalibrated after the leads are returned to the holding chamber, prior to the second half of the trial using the IR socks. During this 15-minute recalibration period, subjects will be allowed to use the restroom and may place loose foot coverings over their feet for ambulation. Following the subjects return to the exam table, the same above protocol will be followed, with 15 minutes of rest/stabilization after the leads are placed back on, followed by another 15 minutes for the baseline readings prior to study sock placement. The study socks will be placed in a similar manner so that the pre-cut holes line up over the fixation rings. Repeat TCPO2 measurements will be obtained according to the same schedule as indicated above. Activity will be restricted during the active and stabilization phase of the protocol. Patients will be encouraged to void prior to initiation of each half of the protocol. However, should subjects have to use the bathroom during one of the active phases, the rest and stabilization phase will restart at time zero following the bathroom break and reattachment of the TCPO2 sensors. At the completion of the study, the leads and fixation rings will be removed and subjects will return placebo and study socks to the appropriate personnel.",

"This is a prospective monocentric, open-label, prospective study of male patients with CoV-2-SARS.", "Introduction: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most prevalent and widely studied peripheral nerve entrapment syndrome, with estimates between 10-20% of the general population having clinical symptoms of CTS at least once in their lifetime. Classically, it presents with symptoms of nocturnal numbness and tingling in the distribution of the median nerve, often progressing to more constant parasthesias, weakness, and pain in the hand and/or wrist, and eventually thenar muscle atrophy. There is a robust and continuously growing body of research available on the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of CTS. Conservative, non-operative management strategies, including night splinting and corticosteroid injections, have shown significant clinical benefit in improving the severity of CTS symptoms and preventing the need for carpal tunnel release (CTR) surgery. However, many patients with mild-moderate CTS will still go on to have CTR due to failure of conservative measures or lack of long-term efficacy. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a safe and extremely well tolerated compound which acts as a powerful antioxidant and has been utilized in the treatment of many conditions including, but not limited to acetaminophen toxicity, various psychiatric disorders, Alzheimer's disease, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Of note, some studies using animal models have shown NAC to be effective in reducing oxidative stress and potentially expediting the recovery of peripheral nerve injuries. This warrants consideration of the potential of NAC to impact peripheral nerve recovery in the non-operative treatment of mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome. Given the safety of NAC, and promising hypotheses to suggest neuroprotective and neuronal growth promoting effects on peripheral nerves, The investigators propose the following project to examine whether supplementation with oral NAC in addition to standard night splinting significantly improves functional outcomes for mild to moderate CTS when compared to splinting alone.\n\nMethods: This study will be a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled human clinical trial. Participants for this study will be recruited by staff, residents, and research assistants on a voluntary basis from both the outpatient Plastic Surgery clinic, Plastic Surgery clinic waiting list, and the Neurology clinic at the Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Center, Halifax Infirmary, in Nova Scotia, Canada. These will include patients both waiting for consultation with a hand surgeon for consideration of carpal tunnel release and patients who have already been assessed by a hand surgeon but have yet to undergo a trial of night splinting.\n\nFor the purposes of this study, a diagnosis of mild to moderate CTS will be primarily determined by clinical history of any intermittent or persistent numbness in the distribution of the median nerve and/or pain in the hand or wrist. Clinical exam findings consistent with a diagnosis of CTS will be determined by a CTS-6 score of 12 or higher, indicating at least an 80% chance of a diagnosis of CTS.\n\nAfter identification of eligible participants, they will be informed of the nature of the study and the proposed intervention and consented both verbally and in writing to participate in the study by a research assistant. They will undergo permutated block randomization to either the placebo controlled or experimental group in a 1:1 ratio. The participants and physicians/assessors will be masked to participant group allocation.\n\nBaseline variables will be collected from each participant including age, gender, smoking status, previous diagnoses of carpal tunnel syndrome, which side is affected or bilateral disease, which side will undergo splinting as determined by severity, previous treatments for carpal tunnel syndrome on both the study and non-study limb (if bilateral disease), clinical and electrodiagnostic severity of CTS, duration of symptoms, nature of onset, any current pain medications for both CTS symptoms and non-CTS related pain, employment status, and comorbidities.\n\nPre-treatment Evaluation: Once the participants have given informed consent and been randomized, they will be asked to complete a baseline Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ). All patients will receive a prescription for a wrist splint and 8 weeks supply of either NAC tablets or a placebo.\n\nPost-treatment Evaluation: Follow-up will take place at eight weeks by the surgeon to whom the patient was referred for consideration of carpal tunnel release. Participants will be asked to complete another BCTQ to be compared to their baseline score. At this time, patients can decide if they wish to proceed with carpal tunnel release surgery or defer surgical treatment.\n\nFor patients that do not decide to proceed with carpal tunnel release surgery, a secondary outcome measure will include a follow up at 6 months, at which time The investigators will collect patient reported outcomes including conversion to surgery, continued use of conservative treatment modalities including night splinting or other treatment modalities, and patient-reported outcomes in the way of a final BCTQ if surgery was not pursued.\n\nOutcome Measures: The primary outcome measure in this study will be the overall score for symptom severity and hand function limitations as determined by the BCTQ at eight weeks post initiation of night splinting therapy. A secondary outcome will be ratio of conversion to surgery versus continuation of conservative treatment or no treatment at all.\n\nData Analysis: For baseline demographic variables, The investigators will use descriptive statistics (means with standard deviations for continuous variables or frequency with percentages for categorical variables) and assess between group similarities. T-test and chi-square tests, where appropriate, will be used to determine significant differences in baseline demographics. The primary between group analysis will be done with multiple linear regression with adjustments made for age at randomization, gender, symptom duration, and baseline BCTQ score, with an aim to identify significant differences in improvements in the BCTQ score between the treatment and control group at eight weeks and six months, where applicable. The investigators will also examine for significance in the ratio of conversion to surgery at eight weeks and six months. Significance will be set as a p-value <0.05.\n\nSample Size: Based on the INSTINCTS trial by Chesterson and colleagues, this study will require 240 total participants (120 per group). The investigators will aim to detect a 15% or greater improvement in the BCTQ from assumed baseline value of 2.9 (scale 1-5, SD 1.0). This would mean a 0.9 point (30%) reduction in the NAC plus splinting group and a 0.45 point (15%) reduction in the placebo plus splinting group, with a pooled SD of 1.0 and mean difference of 0.45. Power will be set at 90%, two-tailed significance at 5%, and a 15% loss to follow up will be anticipated. Recruitment of 120 participants for both the placebo-controlled and NAC groups will primarily be from the practice of a single hand surgeon (DT) and the practices of several local neurologists. The primary hand surgeon (DT) has completed a preliminary audit of his practice and has determined that in the last year, he completed 200 CTRs in the minor procedure clinic.\n\nStrengths and Limitations: This study will have a robust sample size, minimal potential for participant loss, and strong clinical applications in the way of a minimally invasive adjunct to night splinting as a conservative treatment for mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome. This study is limited in that the primary outcome measure is relatively subjective, despite the fact that the BCTQ is a validated tool that has been applied clinically in reputable trials. Additionally, despite controlling for between group variability in baseline function, severity of disease prior to treatment can certainly impact the degree of response to conservative measures and may confound results.\n\nEthical Considerations: Given that the participants in this study will have already decided to pursue investigations and treatment for their carpal tunnel syndrome prior to being informed of and consented for our trial, there is a negligible ethical conflict of exposing a patient to tests and treatments that they would not have otherwise had. Eligible participants will be given the standard information regarding the risks and benefits of both pursuing and delaying carpal tunnel release surgery and will not be delayed or denied surgery should they choose not to participate in the trial. It is, however, acknowledged that there is a remote possibility of placing patients at risk by administering a medication. NAC has been found to be a safe, non-toxic substance with little-to-no reported short or long-term side effects. Participants will be given as much information about the possible intervention as is needed and will be offered the right to withdraw from the study at any point in time without any repercussion to their medical care.",

"Background Myocardial infarction (MI) secondary to atherosclerotic coronary artery disease is mainly due to plaque-rupture with formation of a luminal thrombogenic material. Lesions responsible for MI are more frequently composed of lipid-rich plaques (LRP) in both culprit and in non-culprit lesions compared to lesions in patients with stable angina.\n\nLRP is thought to be main precursor for future coronary events and may also have an impact on complications following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). It has been previously indicated that stent thrombosis (ST) and restenosis often occur when stenting a lipid-rich plaque. And if using angiography guidance only during PCI, there is a potential risk of implantation of a stent edge on a lipid pool, which can result in incomplete stent coverage of a lesion. The incidence of restenosis and ST may be related to the lesion characteristics, clinical presentation, antithrombotic treatment and stent design. Other factors may include inflammatory reaction to the polymer coating containing drug that delays vascular healing, insufficient stent strut coverage and incomplete stent apposition (ISA).\n\nInvasive imaging modality can contribute to better understanding of the changes that occur in the vessel wall during stent implantation.\n\nIntravascular ultrasound (IVUS) combined with a new imaging modality called near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can identify LRP and provide a semi-quantitative estimate of amount of LRP present within selected region of interest. The method is excellent to identify ISA and improve stent implantation technique.\n\nOptical coherence tomography (OCT) is a high resolution imaging modality that can analyze healing pattern after stent implantation such as stent strut coverage.\n\nMethod The study is designed as a prospective randomized trial conducted at a single center (Odense University Hospital). Patients with MI will be enrolled if they fulfill the criteria. The study is submitted and approved by The Regional Committees on Health Research Ethics for Southern Denmark (Project-ID: S-20200010) and Danish Data Agency (Journal nr.: 20/18008).\n\nEligible patients will be randomly assigned to either NIRS-guided PCI or conventual angiography-guided PCI with implantation of Everolimus-eluting Xience stent, which is CE marked. NIRS will be performed in both groups after predilation and stent implantation. In NIRS-guided group the analyses will be used to identify LRP, and to measure vessel wall diameter in reference segments and lesion length. In angiography-guided group the analyses will not be available for the PCI operator and are for observation purpose only. OCT will be performed in both groups after stent implantation, but will be only available for interpretation in NIRS-guided group. In case of reintervention in NIRS-guided group, a final OCT will be performed.\n\nPatients will be contacted by telephone to evaluate the clinical situation and to reduce the potential risk of dropout. After 6 months OCT will be performed in both groups to evaluate stent strut coverage and vessel healing.\n\nStatistics Assuming data are normally distributed, categorical data will be presented as numbers and frequencies and compared using chi2-test. Continuous data will be presented as mean ± SD and compared using Student t test. SPSS version 26.0 will be used for the statistical analysis.\n\nSample size calculation An a priori power calculation at patient level with a mean expected proportion of 75% and 95% covered stent struts at six months in the angio-guided and NIRS-guided group, respectively, shows a sample size of 88 patients is required to reach statistical significance. With 44 patients in each treatment group, and a 2-tailed significance level of 0.05, the study has a power of 80%. With an expected drop-out rate of 15% due to non-compliance in relation to invasive procedures and subject to poor image quality, 104 patients are required to be recruited in the trial.",

Glaucoma can cause irreversible visual impairment. Current treatment modalities only halt disease progression and do not improve visual function. It is important to understand that poor visual function can have major consequences to an individual's day-to-day tasks such as increased risk of falls and automobile accidents.\n\nDisability glare is commonly experienced by eye disease patients, including those with glaucoma, and has been shown to be present even in those who are mildly affected by the disease. MP is a blue-light filter that plays an important role in visual performance including glare sensitivity. Moreover, MP is a potent antioxidant, and it is widely known that oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of glaucoma, both at the level of retinal ganglion cells and trabecular meshwork.\n\nGlaucoma and cognitive decline are both neurodegenerative processes that share several antecedents. The clustering of degenerative disorders towards the end of life is thought to be the result of cumulative and lifelong oxidative injury, and is consistent with the free radical theory of aging. Observational studies have revealed links between the two conditions. The commonalities between glaucoma and cognitive decline, including their shared risk factor profile and pathophysiological pathways, suggest a role for exploring common mechanisms and perhaps even a shared therapeutic approach.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of dietary MP supplementation on MP levels, serum biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress, vision, retinal structure and cognition in glaucoma patients.\n\nStudy design 64 glaucoma participants Treatment arm: 10 mg Lutein, 2 mg zeaxanthin, 10 mg meso-zeaxanthin - 2/3 Placebo arm: Identical capsule containing no active ingredients - 1/3 Duration of intervention: 18 months\n\nAt baseline, all glaucoma participants undergo detailed vision assessments including visual acuity, microperimetry, measurement of macular pigment optical density (MPOD) with dual-wavelength fundus autofluorescence technique, optical coherence tomography scans, contrast sensitivity testing with and without glare, photostress recovery time, pupil reaction assessment, lens fluorescence measurement and fill out vision-related and dietary questionnaires. Patients also undergo detailed cognitive assessment including the flanker task, sound-induced flash illusions task, verbal fluency (FAS and animal fluency tests), SKT (short cognitive assessment) and MMSE (mini-mental state examination) tests which provide measures of reaction time, short-term memory, multisensory integration and attention. A blood sample is also collected for analysis of oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers.\n\nAfter the baseline assessments, glaucoma participants are randomised (2:1) to receive a dietary MP supplementation or placebo for 6 months. Each daily dose of the supplement contains 10mg Lutein, 10mg meso-Zeaxanthin and 2mg Zeaxanthin in a softgel capsule. The intervention consists of a daily oral consumption of one softgel capsule (recommended to be consumed with food) for a period of 18 months, with patients compliance checks and re-supply of supplement every 6 months.

"The incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is one of the most important causes of worldwide mortality and morbidity, increases with age and the disease worsens with the effects of aging. The effects of COPD are not only limited to the lungs, it also affects other organs and systems, causing loss of strength in the respiratory muscles. Respiratory muscles are the skeletal muscles that must maintain their continuous activities for the continuity of life. Just like other skeletal muscles, the respiratory muscles can also be trained based on the principles of exercise. Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) is an exercise method used in both patients with COPD and the elderly population. Studies have shown that IMT has positive effects in COPD and elderly individuals. However, in all these studies IMT applications (also known as \"foundation or conventional IMT\") focus only on the respiratory task of the respiratory muscles. Nevertheless, in addition to their basic task of respiration, respiratory muscles are also involved in core stabilization and postural control.The aim of this study was to create an integrated IMT program for geriatric individuals with and without COPD and investigate its effects.\n\nThe participants were divided into two groups as individuals with and without COPD. A total of 8 weeks of IMT was applied for both groups using a threshold pressure loading device The participants were asked to perform IMT twice a day in the morning and evening. Both groups were trained 3 days a week under the supervision of a physiotherapist and other days of the week without a supervisor. The treatment program consisted of 4 weeks of foundation IMT followed by 4 weeks of functional IMT.The intensity of the exercise was adjusted to 40-50% of the MIP. After 10 consecutive breathing cycles, the participants were asked to perform 3-4 breathe controls. As the tolerance increased, consecutive respiratory cycles were increased. The intensity of MIP was adjusted by weekly MIP measurements. Currently, foundation IMT is commonly used to train respiratory muscles. In the present study, foundation IMT was applied during the first 4 weeks of training. The participants were asked to sit in a comfortable upright position. Then the nose clip was placed, and the patients were instructed to tighten their lips around the mouthpiece and breathe against the resistance. During this 4-week-long training, all IMT applications were performed solely in a sitting position, without any loading in other positions. Following the foundation IMT, all participants underwent four weeks of functional IMT. Initially, all participants were taught diaphragmatic breathing and activating abdominal wall musculature. Each training session started with warm-up exercises and ended with cool-down exercises. During the loading phase, core stability, dynamic trunk activation and postural control exercises were applied together with IMT.",

NA, "In isolated limb perfusion (ILP) neurotoxicity is a known side effect, this is in spite of the fact that a relatively mild hyperthermic temperature is used which should be well tolerated by the nerves and other normal tissues in the limbs. It seems probable that the neurotoxicity observed after ILP results from both a thermal enhancement of drug toxicity combined with a local effect of a high tourniquet pressure that is used to isolate the blood flow. Prevention of regional and systemic toxicity is essential for improving the outcome after the procedure. It is known that both higher doses of melphalan, higher temperatures and longer perfusion time correlates to a higher toxicity. The Wieberdink method is a grading system for the reaction of the normal tissues after ILP and the grading is used as a routine in ILP today. Neurofilament light protein (NfL) is released into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during axonal damage and has been shown to be elevated in different forms of dementia. An NfL assay sensitive enough to measure NfL in blood was recently developed. Its concentration reflects axonal injury in both central and peripheral nervous system disorders.The primary aim of this study is to investigate the possibility to measure neurofilament as a biomarker for peripheral nerve toxicity after isolated limb perfusion.",

NA, "Introduction: Gout has been associated with a number of comorbidities including cardiovascular disease (CVD). Mounting evidence suggests that hyperuricaemia and gout are associated with a high risk for CVD. Gout is closely related to hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obesity and metabolic syndrome, all well-known factors contributing to the development of CVD. Gout management guidelines all agree that comorbidity screening is relevant and thus should be implemented in contemporary gout management. However, no specific strategy for management of CVD risk factors, in a gout population, exists.\n\nObjective: The objective of the Urica Cor Intervention (URICORI) trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of a one-year, intervention of modifiable risk factors for CVD administered in a rheumatology outpatient clinical setting, compared with conventional treatment for modifiable risk factors for CVD in people with gout.\n\nDesign: The study is a randomised, open label, blinded endpoint trial, with balanced randomisation (1:1) conducted in four rheumatology outpatient clinics in Denmark. The investigators aim to recruit 266 people with gout, fulfilling the current EULAR ( European League against Rheumatism)/ ACR (American College of Rheumatology) gout classification criteria. Eligible patients will be randomised to receive either conventional (control group) treatment for CVD risk factors administered by their general practitioner according to national guidelines (NG) versus the URICORI programme, administered at the rheumatology department, targeting the same CVD risk factors according to NG. Both groups will be treated for gout at their local department of rheumatology.\n\nEnd Points: primary end point is a composite endpoint. By inclusion in the URICORI programme all participants will be considered a member of one of four categories derived from the Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation (SCORE) screening programme designed to assess the 10 year risk of fatal cardiovascular disease in European low risk population. As a consequence, participants will be classified as responder after 12 months if all national treatment targets for LDL cholesterol, HbA1c, Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), according to their SCORE risk profile, is met and no commencement of smoking. If not, participants will be classified as non-responders.\n\nKey secondary end points: Change from baseline of LDL cholesterol, HbA1c, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, smoking status and change from baseline in serum urate. Exploratory end points: Proportion of participants achieving treatment target for LDL cholesterol, HbA1c, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, change in smoking status (commencement and cessation) and proportion of participants achieving serum urate < 36.0 mmol/l or serum urate < 0.30 mmol/l for tophaceous disease.\n\nAfter year 1 and year 5, the first occurrence of any serious cardiovascular event (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke or urgent revascularization due to unstable angina) during the URICORI trial will be registered. Death and hospitalisation during the URICORI trial will also be evaluated after year 5. Events will be determined by medical record review and evaluated by the endpoint adjudication committee. The Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) endorsed Core Domain Set for us in trials in gout will measured during and after the one-year URICORI intervention trial.\n\nEthics and dissemination: The local ethics committee in the region of southern Denmark and the Danish data agency in the region of southern Denmark will approve this protocol prior to commencement.", 
"Video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is a type of minimally invasive thoracic surgery (MITS) procedure used for diagnosis or treatment of chest pathologies (pulmonary, mediastinal, chest wall). Most main procedures traditionally performed by open thoracotomy can be performed with smaller incisions using video support. Literature shows that resections performed with VATS result in shorter hospital stay, lower complication rates, lower mortality rates and similar survivability rates in comparison to thoracotomy. While being less invasive in comparison to open surgery options, thoracoscopic surgery may damage the intercostal nerve and damages muscles. Also it provokes soft tissue edema at the incision area. Therefore, pain can be more intense than expected after thoracoscopic procedures. Post-operation pain is not just an acute problem; 20% of the patients develop chronic incision pain after a thoracic surgery.\n\nPost-operative pain is a type of acute pain which starts with surgical procedure and ends with tissue recovery. Eliminating this pain is one of the important purposes of anaesthesia. Post-operative analgesia methods may prevent the patient from feeling pain, but there has been no consensus regarding pain management, and generally a multi-modal approach is the most preferable approach. While various methods are used for post-operation analgesia, studies to increase patient satisfaction are still ongoing.\n\nThoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) and paravertebral block are gold standard of analgesia methods for thoracoscopy operations, and these are widely used for VATS procedures. An epidural application generally performed at the level of T5-7 intervertebral space for thoracic surgery. While intra-operative analgesia is also provided using by an epidural catheter, it is also the first preference in post-operative analgesia management. It can be applied by continuous infusion of local anesthetic, or bolus dosages with 4-6 hours intervals.\n\nErector spina plane block (ESPB) is a type of block applied by injection of a local anaesthetic into the interfacial plane under the erector spina muscle, and it is defined as an analgesic method for thoracic neuropathic pain in 2016. The dermatome area it covers varies according to the level of application. It can be applied under USG guidance and its application may be considered less invasive in comparison to thoracic epidural. Due to its easier application it can prove to be a more popular approach in the future. In thoracic surgeries, single-shut at the T5-6 level can be used or multiple shuts at multiple levels can be applied or continue analgesia can be applied by catheter\n\nThere has been no randomised controlled study comparing epidural versus erector spinae plane block in the literature.\n\nparticiants hypothesis is that continue ESP block catheter application is non-inferior than epidural catheter application in the first post-operative 48 hours regarding post-operative pain relief. The purpose of this study is to invertigate the effects of TEA and ESPB on post-operative pain in patients undergoing VATS.", 
NA, NA, "INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE Mechanical ventilation (MV) is a frequently applied and often a life-saving strategy in neurocritically ill patients. Paradoxically, ventilation itself has the potential to cause further pulmonary and cerebral damage and can increase mortality and morbidity [1].\n\nThe so-called 'protective lung ventilation' strategies include the use of low tidal volume (TV), positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), and eventually recruitment maneuvers (RMs), and are aimed to prevent lung damage and to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [2]. In particular, low tidal volume seems to have the greater importance [3-5], and guidelines strongly recommend its use in critically ill patients with ARDS [6].\n\nResults from one multicenter randomized controlled trial suggest that also ICU patients without ARDS could benefit from 'protective lung ventilation strategies [7]. A recent meta-analysis showed a higher incidence of pulmonary complications and even increased mortality in patients who received 'conventional ventilation' with traditionally sized or higher tidal volumes compared to patients undergoing protective strategies [8].\n\nPresent ventilation guidelines for patients with acute brain injury The fourth edition of the Guidelines for the Management of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury [10] suggests maintaining normocapnia in this subset of patients and aiming for peripheral saturation of oxygen higher than 90% to guarantee an adequate cerebral perfusion and avoid secondary brain damages due to hypoxia or inappropriate cerebral vasodilatation [10]. However, BTF guidelines do not provide any advice on ventilator settings or targets. There is still uncertainty regarding the use of protective ventilation in neurologically ill patients. Brain injured patients have been traditionally excluded from the major trials regarding mechanical ventilation and the use of lung protective ventilator strategies because low tidal volumes, high PEEP and RMs can increase carbon dioxide levels (CO2) and increase intrathoracic pressure, thus having detrimental effects on intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP).\n\nMETHODS\n\nObjectives\n\nThis observational study aims to determine the ventilation practice of consecutive intubated and ventilated neuro-ICU patients in the first week from admission in intensive care units.\n\n2. Primary objective is to determine ventilation settings of intubated and mechanically ventilated neurocritically ill patients admitted to the ICU.\n\n3. Secondary objectives are: 3.1. The association of ventilator settings and targets with outcome in the whole population 3.2. The differences in ventilator settings among different countries 3.3. To assess the incidence of pulmonary complications (including pneumonia, ARDS, neurogenic pulmonary edema) in this cohort of patients.\n\n3.4. To assess the ventilator settings applied when intracranial pressure is raised (>20 mmHg).\n\nOutcomes will be assessed as:\n\n6-months mortality and neurological outcome (as for extended Glasgow Outcome Scale, eGOS),\nHospital length of stay (in days), in hospital mortality.\nMortality, duration of mechanical ventilation (in days), ventilator free days (days) at ICU discharge\n\nHypotheses\n\nIn patients with acute brain injury, protective ventilation strategies are not often applied; in particular, tidal volumes are higher than those used in patients with no brain injury. The adoption of protective ventilation in this group of patients might result in a beneficial effect on outcome.\nVentilation practice, in particular tidal volume size, varies among patients with acute brain injury and among different centers and different countries.\nIn patients with acute brain injury outcomes can be dependent on ventilator setting.\n\nStudy design\n\nInternational multicenter prospective observational study of consecutive ventilated neuro-ICU patients in the first week since admission to ICU.\n\nStudy population\n\nWe will collect data of consecutive patients with acute brain injury intubated and ventilated, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).\n\nSample size calculation\n\nThe primary endpoint of the study is the exploration of the ventilator settings in clinical practice in braininjured patients. The hypotheses of the study are exploratory; hence a sample size calculation has not been conducted. This international prospective observational study aims to recruit>3000 patients in coma after acute brain damage admitted to >200 Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Recruitment will last 12 weeks at each center, aiming to enroll about 20 patients/center. To avoid any overrepresentation of some centers we ceil the data collection to 30 patients/center. This number of enrolled patients and ICUs reflects an adequate sample size to capture a range of variation in practice between ICUs. We aim to include also low-middle income countries, in order to have a representation of the variability worldwide.\n\nFollow-up/Outcomes\n\nEnrolled patients will be followed until ICU-discharge or death (whatever comes first), for collection of patient demographics (on day of admission), and ventilation characteristics (from start of ventilation till stop of ventilation). At 6 months, data on length of hospital stay and outcome (Extended Glasgow Coma Scale) will be collected.\n\nOutcomes will be assessed as:\n\n6-months mortality and neurological outcome (as for extended Glasgow Outcome Scale, eGOS)\nHospital length of stay (in days), in hospital mortality.\nMortality, duration of mechanical ventilation (in days), ventilator free days (days) at ICU discharge.\n\nStudy procedures\n\nPatients in participating centers are screened on a daily basis. ICU-patients under mechanical ventilation and with diagnosis of acute brain injury will be included. Demographic data on screened patients regardless of meeting enrollment criteria will be recorded (registry).\n\nThe inclusion period will be flexible for participating centers and determined at a later stage together with the study-coordinator.\n\nTimes points of data collection\n\nDemographic data and baseline data, including severity scores (e.g. APACHE II- scores and SAPS III) will be collected from clinical files on the day of start of mechanical ventilation.\nVentilation settings, gas exchange variables and vital parameters will be collected once daily in the morning till the day when ventilation is stopped or till day 7, whichever comes first.\nChest radiography data from available chest X-rays (i.e., no extra chest X-rays are obtained) in the first week.\nLung echography data are collected from clinical files in the first week.\nPredefined complications are recorded from medical chart (Appendix 1)\nAt ICU discharge: mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation (in days), ventilator free days (days).\nAt 6-months: mortality and neurological outcome (as for extended Glasgow Outcome Scale, eGOS), length of stay (in days), in hospital mortality.\n\nInclusion During a 3 months period, all admitted patients will be screened daily by a local investigator.\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS\n\nPatient characteristics will be compared and described by appropriate statistics. Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U-tests will be used to compare continuous variables and chi-squared tests will be used for categorical variables. Data will be expressed as means (SD), medians (interquartile range) and proportions as appropriate. Comparisons between and within groups will be performed using one-way ANOVA and post-hoc analyses for continuous variables.\n\nPlan of analysis The primary analysis will concern the determination of (variation of) the ventilator settings in neurologically critically ill patients. Univariate analysis will be performed to identify potential factors associated with outcomes including, but not limited to, GOS, mortality, duration of ventilation, or hospital LOS. A multivariate logistic regression model will be used to identify independent risk factors. A stepwise approach will be used to enter new terms into the model, with a limit of p < 0.2 to enter the terms. Time to event variables will be analyzed using Cox regression and visualized by Kaplan-Meier. Statistical analyses will be conducted using R. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS Ethical standards The PI and Steering Committee will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformity with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practices.\n\nEthics committee Each NC/PI will notify the relevant ethics committee, in compliance with the local legislation and rules. The national coordinators will facilitate this process. The approval of the protocol (if required by local authorities) must be obtained before any participant is enrolled. Any amendment to the protocol will require review and approval by the SC before the changes are implemented to the study.\n\nLack of capacity and Delayed Consent Informed consent will be obtained from patients with no lack of capacity. For patients not be able to provide informed consent at the time of recruitment, the responsible clinical/research staff will act as Consulter and consent eligible patients after discussion with the next- of-kin.If the patient has a Power of Attorney or a Legal tutor or an, he/she will act as Consultee and will be asked to consent/decline participation to the study on legal behalf of the patient.\n\nIf patients have Advance Decision Plan including participation in research studies the Plan will be respected and recruitment pursued/abandoned accordingly. At follow-up, patients who have regained capacity will be asked to provide Informed Consent and will be given the possibility to:\n\nProvide Informed Consent for the acute data and follow-up.\nDeny research participation and request destruction of acute data collected.\n\nExpected impact of the study The investigators expect to obtain data of >3000 patients admitted to ICU. These data will allow a detailed description of patient's characteristics, management strategies resource use and correlation with clinical outcomes. In particular, the study will provide insights in relation to clinical management, monitoring and treatment, practice variation in neurointensive care units around the world, differences in the ventilator management of brain injured patients and their potential association with outcome.",

"Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is the most common neuromonitoring modality used in neurocritical care (NCCU). Its application both as a stand-alone monitoring or in association with other systems (brain oxygenation, brain microdialysis, electroencephalography, transcranial Doppler ultrasound, etc.) has several indications, which rely on local, national policies, and international guidelines. In 2014, ESICM with the Neurocritical Care Society released a multidisciplinary Consensus Statement to provide a guidance on Multimodality Monitoring in Neurocritical Care, including ICP[1]: \"ICP and CPP monitoring are recommended as a part of protocol-driven care in patients who are at risk of elevated intracranial pressure based on clinical and/or imaging features. (Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence)\". The most recent Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines focused on the importance of ICP monitoring, especially in severe traumatic brain injury[2], but a living systematic review showed that the compliance rate to these guidelines was low (31%; range 18-83%)[3]. Most of the ICP monitoring guidance orbits around traumatic brain injury, while there are uncertainties around indication of ICP monitoring in non-traumatic brain injury (acute subarachnoid hemorrhage and intracerebral hemorrhage) [4-7] Similarly, ICP thresholds, threshold-based treatment strategies[8-12] and their impact on outcome have not been established yet[13]. The interpretation of data on ICP practice has a limited value without some reference to the intensity of therapy directed at control of ICP[14]. The Therapy Intensity Level (TIL) may be a more sensitive measure of the severity of pathophysiology but the effect on outcome of existing differences in practice is unclear.\n\nIn most intensive care units, ICP values are summarized hourly in bedside charts by trained nurses, as end-hour ICP, and similar data have been used in large randomized clinical trials testing neuroprotective treatments for TBI patients.\n\nHowever, several single center studies showed that this manual acquisition method is suboptimal and could miss episodes of high ICP compared to high-resolution, computerized acquisition systems[15]. Computers allow also the computation offline of ICP derived parameters. Vik[9] proposed that the degree of ICP above the treatment threshold can be estimated by the area under the curve (AUC) of ICP versus time in patients with TBI, i.e. the \"ICP dose\". A significant relationship between the ICP dose, the worst Marshall CT score, and patient outcome exists, suggesting that the AUC method may be useful in refining and improving the treatment of ICP in patients with TBI. Moreover, small cohort studies confirmed this relationship between the dose of ICP and patient outcome, suggesting that the dose of ICP may be useful in refining and improving the treatment of ICP in patients with TBI. In a single centre cohort TBI study[16], increased ICP dose was associated with mortality and poor functional outcome at 6 months. However, there was no association between episodic ICP data and outcome, proposing this index as candidate \"biomarker\" of the disease.\n\nEven if the concept is attracting, all these computations have been collected a posteriori and no single ICP monitoring system was able to display the ICP dose continuously, making it useful at the bedside.\n\nThe new Integra CereLink ICP monitor integrate the possibility of recording and displaying continuously the AUC (Pressure Time Dose, PTD) and other ICP derived variables and provide the possibility of evaluating the utility of this information at the bedside. It offers the opportunity to test in a standardized way the clinical value of the PTD computation in this setting.\n\nTherefore, we aim to test clinically if PTD recorded continuously is associated to patients' outcome and we aim to identify a threshold of PTD associated with the transition from good to negative outcomes.\n\nPrimary aim:\n\n• to assess the association between PTD and in-hospital mortality.\n\nSecondary aims:\n\nto assess the association between PTD and 6 months GOSE (Glasgow Outcome Scale extended);\nto identify the PTD summary measure (e.g. mmHg/h max, mmHg/day, mmHg/week) that maximize the outcome prediction;\nto compare the outcome predictiveness of PTD and end hour ICP\n\nEndpoints:\n\nIn-hospital mortality;\nGOSE at 6 months;\nGOSE at hospital discharge.\n\nHypothesis:\n\nHigh PTD is associated with worse outcome.\nA threshold of PTD associated with good outcomes (mortality and 6 months outcome) might be identified.\nA better PTD summary report, more closely associated with outcome, will make this parameter useful at the bedside.\n\nMethods:\n\nThe study is prospective, observational, international cohort study in centers already using the new Integra CereLink ICP monitor (released in spring 2019).\n\nTreatments and clinical decisions will not be affected by the participation to the protocol that is purely observational.\n\nInpatients who meet the following requirements are eligible for enrollment:\n\nAged within 18 and 80 years;\nDiagnosed of an acute brain injury (ABI) for hemorrhagic stroke (including intracerebral hematoma or subarachnoid hemorrhage) or traumatic brain injury;\nICP monitoring started for clinical indication and accordingly to local policies\nICP device connected to the Integra CereLink ICP monitor.\n\nExclusion criteria are:\n\nICP monitoring not inserted\nNo availability of the Integra CereLink ICP monitor.\n\nPotential centers involved are listed in the Addendum.\n\nEach investigator will notify the relevant ethics committee, in compliance with the local legislation and rules. Since patients recruited in this study will not be able to provide an informed consent at the time of recruitment (patient in coma requiring ICP monitoring), the responsible clinical/research staff will act as Consultee and consent eligible patients after discussion with the next-of-kin. At follow-up, patients who have regained capacity will be asked to provide Informed Consent for the acute data and follow-up or deny research participation and request destruction of acute data collected.\n\nData collection will be web-based. Participating centres will register electronically and collect data via an electronic Case-Report Form (RedCAP) and data will be anonymized locally. The data resides at the University Milano-Bicocca; all procedures will comply with the EU regulation on data protection 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons regarding personal data processing and movement.\n\nA reduced set of demographic characteristics, past medical history information, diagnosis, timeline, clinical presentation of ABI and administered treatments will be extracted from patients' medical records.\n\nICP high-resolution data will be downloaded from the Integra CereLink ICP monitor:\n\nmean ICP;\nICP dose. Centres will collect mortality and GOSE at ICU/hospital discharge and GOSE at 6 months. The GOSE at the End-of-Study will be collected via phone structured interviews to patients and/or family members using a validated questionnaire.\n\nData accuracy will be verified automatically in the database through validity and consistency checks on relevant variables and, additionally, a trained staff at the University of Milano-Bicocca in Monza will periodically perform checks of completeness and consistency of the information to ensure data quality.\n\nStatistical plan:\n\nDescriptive statistics will be used to summarize demographic, clinical features and outcomes. Kaplan-Maier estimates will be used to describe mortality and the Cox model to assess the association with PTD adjusting for potential confounders. The shared frailty joint model will be used to assess the predictiveness of the longitudinal PTD profile on mortality. The logistic model will be used to assess the role of PTD on GOSE dichotomized as poor and good outcome (poor outcome GOSE: 1-4; good outcome GOSE: 5-8). All tests will be two-sided with a significant level of 0.05.\n\nNo formal sample size calculation was performed but based on the potentiality of recruitment of the centers involved in the study, we expect to enrol at least 200 patients (with an average of 15 patients per center).\n\nExpected results:\n\nThe PTD (Pressure Time Dose) recorded by the Integra CereLink ICP monitor is related with outcome. Higher PTD are associated with worse outcomes.\nThe max PTD associated with good outcomes will be estimated.\nWe aim to identify the best way of summarizing PDT for clinical use.\nTo demonstrate that PTD is a better predictor of outcome compared with end-hour ICP values (standard now)\n\nEthical aspects:\n\nThis is a prospective observational cohort study: no additional costs will be attribute to the Insitution/s.\n\nData collection will be web-based. Participating centres will collect data via an electronic Case-Report Form (REDCAP cloud); data will be automatically pseudoanonymized with a numeric alpha code; the list of correspondence between the patient's code and its identity will be stored in a safe place and access to this data will be granted only to study PI and study staff delegated by the PI and listed in the delegation log.

"Danish departments of occupational medicine examine around 10,000 patients each year referred due to suspected work-related disorders. In Denmark and internationally there is a lack of follow-up studies investigating the long-term prognosis of employees with work-related disorders. The purpose of this cohort is to facilitate long-term prognostic studies for conditions such as mental or musculoskeletal disorders.\n\nThe Danish Occupational Medicine cohort has been created through The Danish National Patient Register and comprises all patients seen in Danish Departments of Occupational Medicine from 2000-2018 (N=145.521). Numerous register data are included in the database from five years prior to time of inclusion until 2018. Examples of register data are; information on work, sickness absence and disability as well as number and type of contacts to health services, use of medication, income, education, type of occupation, social status, death and cause of death. Job Exposure Matrices (JEMs) on physical and psychosocial work exposure, life styles and other matrices are also available.

The goal of TPAPN is to help the nurse return to safe nursing practice. Currently, TPAPN does not offer a wellness intervention as part of their services. The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and feasibility of a self-management wellness intervention that is integrated, prescriptive, and trackable in a population of Texas nurses referred to a peer assistance monitoring program for an identified substance use and/or mental health condition or related incident. It is expected that this 30-day integrated, prescriptive, and trackable wellness intervention (combining five wellness elements including exercise, mindfulness, sleep, social connectedness, and nutrition) will be found to be an efficacious program for those with nurses enrolled in TPAPN.\n\nNurses are more susceptible to maladaptive coping behaviors, including turning to substance use or abuse, due to workplace stressors (Jarrad et al., 2018). Participating in a nursing monitoring program may increase stress in an already highly stressful profession; monitoring requirements alone can cause feelings of embarrassment and guilt (Mumba, 2018). It is the hope that adding the KickStart30 program, previously studied in a population with mental health issues (Rolin et al., 2019; NCT03993548) to the current offerings of TPAPN will result in the nurse replacing negative coping mechanisms with the positive coping mechanism, increasing long-term recovery and decreasing the likelihood of making an error in the workplace.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, even though there is abundant research supporting each of the KickStart30 elements (exercise, mindfulness, sleep, social connectedness, and nutrition) individually, there is no research exploring the effectiveness of an integrated, prescriptive, and trackable wellness intervention combining these five elements specific to a cohort of nurses. Therefore, this work will be unique in that it will collect both objective and subjective data to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of this type of wellness intervention. It will lend support to the growing body of research on the efficacy of wellness interventions for a variety of different health conditions, as well as a community-based population. Finally, it is hoped that positive results will yield increased access to and utilization of this type of intervention, thereby improving public health.\n\nThe recruitment period will be open for 12 months to obtain a maximum of 50 participants. The study population will be nurses, ages 18 and older, interested in improving their overall wellness as part of the TPAPN program. Potential participants will be recruited via TPAPN Case Managers, Peer Support Partners, and Program Director who will provide recruitment flyers to potential participants. The study flyer will be posted to the TPAPN website as well as a informational video for potential participants to view. Interested individuals will be provided a toll-free phone number belonging to study personnel, which will be monitored daily Monday through Friday. Study personnel will reply to interested parties with a verbal screening/orientation call to determine eligibility. If the participant meets study criteria, the participant will be emailed a link to the online consent form, registration form, and program forms. Participants will have the option to download a PDF of their signed consent form for their records at the time of signing/completion. Study personnel will collect the participant's email address, physical mailing address, and assign the participant a unique identification code based on the order in which the participant was screened\n\nStudy personnel will mail each participant a KickStart30 Workbook within one day of emailing participants their unique identification codes. Participants will be instructed to document adherence of their daily wellness practices and their daily HERO exercises online via Qualtrics, an online survey software. Participants can document their daily adherence using their computer and/or their smartphone as Qualtrics offers a mobile version of the Participant Tracking Form. A copy of the Participant Tracking Form will also be available in the KickStart30 Workbook so participants that prefer keeping a daily paper log can do so, and they can then transfer their program adherence information to the online Participant Tracking Form at their convenience throughout the program. The workbook will contain the participant's personal identification code; no personal identification will appear in the workbook in order to protect participant confidentiality. Participants will also receive daily motivational emails from MailChimp, which will provide general information about one of the five wellness elements and/or one of the HERO wellness traits, as well as encouragement to track their participation on a daily basis, and encouragement to contact study personnel via email with any questions and/or concerns.\n\nData capture will occur at two points: once prior to beginning the study and again at the end of the 30-day study. Data will be collected online through program forms; all data will be hosted on Qualtrics, an online survey software. Program Forms assess items including depression, anxiety, wellbeing, mindfulness, sleep quality, social connectedness, emotional eating, pain, disability, physical function, cognition, substance and alcohol use, suicidality, happiness, enthusiasm, resilience, and optimism.\n\nDescriptive statistics will be used to discuss pre- and post-intervention scores.\n\nDifferences between pretest and 30-day measures will be assessed with repeated measures ANOVA, with a p value of less than 0.05 indicating statistical significance.",

NA, NA, "The skills and the knowledge necessary in COPD management and interventions required to develop this skill have conceptualized as self-management. The complex structure of COPD self-management includes medication compliance, smoking cessation, maintaining and increasing exercise capacity, regulating nutrition, healthy lifestyle changes, vaccination and symptom management.\n\nAccording to the GOLD (2017) report, copd self-management cannot be achieved only with didactic teaching. Skill acquisition, behavior change and motivational interventions should be applied with education. Among these interventions, action plans are among the tools frequently used in preventing tele-health COPD attacks. Action plans can be used effectively in COPD to prevent attacks, symptom management and reduce the risk of anxiety / depression. One objectives of self-management is to reduce use of health care. Symptom management; It has been stated that it is effective in reducing hospitalization and days of hospitalization especially in patients with COPD diseases.\n\nIn studies involving self-management in COPD, self-management interventions increase health-related quality of life, control symptom, reduce the risk of anxiety / depression, increase self-efficacy, reduce respiratory hospital stays, reduce severity and duration of attacks, and reduce mortality at low impact. It is stated that the interventions made in the GOLD (2017) report provide improvements for health-related quality of life and patient outcomes. Because of self-management is a multi-component concept, variety in type of intervention and follow-up make it difficult to reach generalizable evidence.\n\nAlthough many health professionals work with patients with COPD, self-management interventions are known to be carried out mostly by nurses or by multidisciplinary groups involving nurses.\n\nThis study is an example of applicable self-management intervention in terms of disease information and general management, rational drug use, symptom control training and evaluation with medium-term monitoring. It can contribute to literature in terms of determining the effect of nurse-managed self-management intervention.",

Then, participants will be asked questions about their behavior intentions (e.g., stay in a specific room in my home and stay away from all other people and pets, visit a friend or family member in person). Participants will also be asked construct questions based off of Theory of Planned Behavior/Reason Action Approach (located in the pre-test survey), along with a set of demographic questions.\n\nSurvey responses will be summarized for the full sample, as well as stratified by testing scenario. Quantitative responses will be summarized using means, standard deviations and quartiles, and categorical and ordinal responses will be summarized using frequency distributions. Comparisons between scenarios will be performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for quantitative variables, Kruskal-Wallis tests for ordinal variables, and chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests as appropriate for categorical variables.\n\nThe primary outcome is a difference in the behavioral sum score constructed using 11 items, composed of two subscales. Secondary outcomes include the 'personal decisions' and 'social expectations' subscales respectively. The 'personal decisions' subscale will consist of the items pertaining to masking, self-isolation, visiting friends, purchasing supplies, undertaking physical activity, eating at a restaurant and having dinner at home with friends. The 'social expectations' subscale will consist of the items pertaining to getting a haircut, attending weddings, funerals, and birthday parties.

By an unbiased researcher, the patients were recruited to the groups using the envelope method; control group (with flap raised) or test group (without flap raised) were assigned.\n\nA total of 24 patients complying with these criteria were included in the study and a total of 37 implants were applied to the patients.\n\nImplant applications of the patients in the control group were performed by lifting the flap. The implants of the patients included in the test group were applied without lifting the flap.\n\nFor each implant in the study marginal bone loss were evaluated; Digital bite-wing x-rays taken with a standard technique were used.Bite-wing x-rays taken were standardized with bite blocks on the film holder prepared individually for each patient. From each implant site; two x-rays were taken first immediately after implant surgery and the second three months later, just before the uncovering session of the implants. Digital bite-wing x-rays were transferred to RadiAnt Dicom Viewer program and measurements were made on them. Implant diameter values which is known in the images are accepted as reference.The diameter in the image was measured and a coefficient was obtained by dividing the real diameter to measurement on image. In the images, the distance between the most coronal point of the implant neck and the point where the implant bone contact first occurred was measured. This distance was divided by the coefficient obtained and its actual values are obtained in mm.The difference between these distances at two time points were recorded in patient forms as marginal bone loss. In statistical analysis, comparisons between groups were made.\n\nAll the individuals included in the study came to the control appointments on the 3rd and 7th days after implant surgery, and the sutures were also taken on the 7th day. All patients were asked to fill the Turkish translation of Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) forms three times: preoperatively, postoperative day 3, and postoperative day 7. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) forms were asked to be marked by the patients on the 3rd and 7th days after the operation. VAS forms were prepared as a horizontal line with one side being the lowest score and the other side with highest score. VAS forms were prepared to be in 0-100 mm and the point marked by the patient was measured in cm. In VAS forms, patients were asked to mark according to their post-operative pain status.\n\nStatistical analysis of the data in this study was done with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 20 (International Business Machines Corporation Somers, New York, USA) package program.In the evaluation of the data, besides descriptive statistical methods (mean, standard deviation), T test was used for comparisons between groups.

"Elevations in state anxiety, when moderate and temporary, serve an adaptive function in pandemic contexts, facilitating health behaviors like self-protection and social distancing. However, for some people elevated state anxiety transitions to anxiety disorders, creating undue suffering and impairment. Nearly 33% of both Wuhan residents and Chinese citizens screened positive for generalized anxiety disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic, with uncontrollable, persistent COVID-19-related worries strongly predicting presence of GAD. Similarly, large surveys indicate that levels of anxiety symptoms are rising among United States citizens.\n\nThis finding aligns with a large body of literature indicating stronger perceived control over one's own anxiety buffers against a variety of anxiety disorders. Thus, in the context of COVID-19, there is a pressing need for materials that might strengthen perceived control over anxiety, thereby reducing risk for anxiety disorder onset. Ideally, such materials would (1) in no way undermine positive health behaviors, like social distancing, and (2) have capacity for broad-scale, immediate accessibility. Internet-based interventions may particularly valuable during the pandemic stage of COVID-19 due to the need for social distancing, and they have already scaled up to address needs in China. However, drop out from internet-based interventions can be up to 83% and intervention engagement is a frequent issue. Fortunately, single-session experiences (SSEs) can improve mental health related outcomes with similar effect sizes as multi-session therapies, and pilot data from our team suggests they can increase general perceived control (within-group dz = 0.70).\n\nThe goal of this project is to test a web-based platform where people can confidentially access and provide feedback on brief activities, called 'single-session experiences' (SSEs), which are about 8 minutes in length, entirely self-administered, and computer-based (Contain COVID Anxiety and Project Remain COVID Free). Previous activities following the same best practices as these experiences have been shown to be safe to complete; predicted significant reductions in psychological distress; and are entirely self-administered. We will recruit a weighted-probability sample of the United States through Prolific's online platform, N = 500. All data collected from the SSEs will be confidential, and the only identifiable information that will be recorded is the participants' Prolific ID to facilitate compensation, which will be deleted from the data after the compensation has been paid. Those that choose to complete the activities have the option to submit their advice to their peers and have it posted anonymously to the web-based platform. This will provide people with an option for an easily accessible activity designed to promote healthy coping skills and resilience in a welcoming environment through which they can learn with others and share experiences.",

Several studies have demonstrated that cord clamping timing is greatly relevant for facilitate placental transfusion, the transfer of extra blood from the placenta to the infant in the third stage of labor. Therefore, during' natural', 'two-step delivery umbilical cord management may play a relevant role on blood passage to the neonate and it may affect neonatal hematological values (placental transfusion). The most effective way to manage umbilical cord in in 'natural', two-step delivery remains to be established. Objective: The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of two different methods of umbilical cord management ECC vs. DCC) on the placental transfusion, defined by <U+0394> haematocrit (Hct) from arterial cord blood at birth and capillary blood at 48 h of age, accounting for physiological body weight decrease. Secondary outcome included contemporary estimate of pH in arterial cord blood gas analysis at birth.\n\nMaterial and methods: This is a randomized clinical trial on the effect of different cord management in newborns by 'natural', two-step delivery. After obtaining parental consent, all mothers > 38 weeks' gestation will be assigned to either ECC or DCC group in a 1:1 ratio, according to a randomized sequence generated by an opened, sealed, numbered, opaque envelope containing the cord clamping interventions allocation, ECC (at 1 minute) or DCC (at 3 minutes after delivery).",
