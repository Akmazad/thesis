 "BriefSummary": "More than half of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) workers report work-related mental and physical fatigue. Odds of injury among fatigued EMS workers are nearly double that of non-fatigued workers. There is a compelling need to reduce fatigue among EMS workers, yet few EMS organizations have a formal fatigue management program and many may not be cost-effective or evidence-based. This trial addresses national goals of the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) and tests a novel approach to fatigue risk management that is easily scalable to large workforces and low-cost for employers of shift workers.",
"DetailedDescription": "The investigators will test an enhanced version of our SleepTrackTXT pilot intervention - Sleep and Fatigue Treatment in EMS (SaFTiE) - in a two-arm parallel cluster-randomized design of 36 EMS agencies. Our unit of randomization will be the EMS agency, with the intervention deployed as a Fatigue Risk Management Program that can be integrated into an agency's existing program. Prior to randomization the investigators will use a run-in period of 60 days with all 36 agencies to capture the natural history of the target population whereby they are naive to the study intervention. During the active intervention phase, the investigators will use SaFTiE and an attention placebo control (APC) group to test the specific effect of our multi-component intervention on EMS worker fatigue and sleep health."

 "BriefSummary": "In pediatric cardiac surgery, transfusion requirements are associated with age, development status, pathology, type of surgical intervention and extracorporeal bypass. In adult cardiac surgery, reinterventions (redo)are clearly linked to higher transfusion rates. The investigators want to study if this association is also true in pediatric cardiac surgery.",
"DetailedDescription": "Whereas in adult cardiac surgery, redo-interventions are clearly linked to a higher transfusion rate, this is not really known in paediatric cardiac surgery. In this retrospective study, the investigators will analyse our database for paediatric cardiac surgery patients aged 0-16 years and operated between 2002 and 2017. Patients with a single cardiac surgery will be compared to patients with a second cardiac operation under extracorporeal bypass. The investigators will test the variables for normal distribution using a Shapiro-Wilk test. Non normal distributed variables will be compared by a non-parametric test (Mann Whitney U), frequency analysis will be done by a Chi-Square test. A univariate analysis will determine predicting factors for transfusion. Factors with a P value < 0.1 will be analysed by a multivariate analysis to determine independent factors for transfusion. Odds with 95% confidence intervals will be calculated. A P value < 0.05 will be considered statistically significant."

 "BriefSummary": "The primary goal of this study is to test the effectiveness of KEEP (Keeping Foster Parents Supported and Trained), an intervention intended to increase supports and consultation to foster parents, and to evaluate the transferability of the proposed intervention from Oregon to the foster care system in San Diego.",
"DetailedDescription": "Children in the foster care system are growing in number, are at high risk for psychological problems, and are increasingly challenging to their foster parents. Foster parents who are trying to provide care and nurturing to these children are often doing so without benefit or meaningful or relevant consultation on developmental and mental health issues. The study tests the effectiveness of an intervention intended to increase supports and consultation to foster parents. A major aim of this study was to test the transferability of the proposed intervention from Oregon to the foster care system in San Diego in 3 regions of Health and Human Services. A cascading dissemination model will be employed, where the original developers train and supervise staff in San Diego to implement the intervention, and in the second iteration of the of the intervention, the involvement of the original developers lessened. The intervention is designed to provide foster parents with general support and specific parent management training (PMT), a well-documented and effective intervention approach. In a previous efficacy trial, PMT had positive effects with foster parents in three areas: 1) reduction of child symptoms, 2) lower rates of disruption in foster care (changes in placements for negative reasons), and 3) fewer foster parents in the PMT condition dropped out of providing foster care. Outcomes will be evaluated at multiple levels, including child symptoms, functional behavior, environments, consumer perspectives, and system using a multi-method/multi-agent strategy. Implementation fidelity will be assessed, as will contextual factors, including the organizational climate and social isolation/insularity of the foster parents. It is hypothesized that, compared to controls, foster parents in the intervention group will improve on parenting skills, feel more supported, and have less stress, which in turn will result in more positive child outcomes, including fewer reported child symptoms and higher levels of child functional behavior in three domains (i.e., home, school, with peers). Improvements in foster parent outcomes and child outcomes are both hypothesized to predict system-level outcomes, including child use of mental health services, foster parent retention, and placement disruptions. Contextual factors are expected to impact foster parent outcomes directly and child and system outcomes indirectly, through implementation fidelity."

 "BriefSummary": "To compare intravenous levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin regarding their risk on the corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation and dysglycemia in diabetic and non-diabetic patients.",
"DetailedDescription": "Fluoroquinolones represent an important class of antibacterial drug and they are used worldwide.Fluoroquinolones are classified into generations according to the spectrum of antimicrobial activities that targeted them.Fluoroquinolones may cause several side effects as tendon rupture, central nervous toxicity, cardiovascular toxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, phototoxicity, disrupted glucose metabolism, skin disorders and hypersensitivity. Ciprofloxacin, a second generation fluoroquinolone, is one of the most successful and widely used compounds of fluoroquinolone. On the other hand, levofloxacin is a third generation fluoroquinolone.\n\nDiabetes mellitus (DM) is chronic disease and a serious of metabolic disorder associated with the presence of hyperglycemia due to partial or complete insulin deficiency. Diabetes mellitus is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.\n\nFluoroquinolone class is associated with cardiac side effects as QTc prolongation. Some agents of fluoroquinolones were withdrawn from market. However, cardiac adverse effects has been developed with fluoroquinolones still in market. Members of fluoroquinolones class have different effects on QT interval. The US FDA suggested that the risk and benefits ratio of fluoroquinolones should be taken into consideration.\n\nIn addition to hyperglycemia events are more common with fluoroquinolones than with other classes of antibiotics. The food and drug administration (FDA) confirmed the current warning that fluoroquinolones may cause decrease in blood sugar especially in diabetic patients. However, other study proved that fluoroquinolones may cause dysglycemic events in diabetic and non-diabetic patients."

Participants may have received prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy for CRC, as long as it was completed at least 6 months prior to initiation of first-line FOLFOX + bevacizumab induction treatment.\n\nHas experienced unacceptable toxicity to oxaliplatin that, in the opinion of the treating physician, requires/required the discontinuation of oxaliplatin. Note: As an example, unacceptable toxicity may include (but is not limited to) severe or prolonged neurotoxicity.\n\n• Participants must be randomized within a minimum of 2 weeks and a maximum of 6 weeks after their last dose of FOLFOX + bevacizumab (last dose is the day of the last infusion).\n\nHas provided to the imaging contract research organization (iCRO) at least 1 set of radiographic images taken during the FOLFOX + bevacizumab induction period and at least 42 days prior to the imaging performed during screening. The iCRO must determine the images are of diagnostic quality prior to randomization.\nHas an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1 within 10 days prior to randomization.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nHas known hypersensitivity to the components and/or excipients in bevacizumab, 5-FU or olaparib.\nHas known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically stable (ie, without evidence of progression for at least 28 days by repeat imaging (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically stable and without requirement of steroid intervention for at least 14 days prior to first dose of study intervention.\nHas an active infection requiring systemic therapy.\nHas a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. No HIV testing is required unless mandated by local health authority.\nHas a known history of or is positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg reactive) or hepatitis C ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA [qualitative]) is detected). Note: No testing for hepatitis B and hepatitis C is required unless mandated by local health authority.\nHas a known psychiatric or substance abuse disorder that would interfere with the participant's ability to cooperate with the requirements of the study.\nHas myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML) or with features suggestive of MDS/AML.\nHas hemoptysis or hematemesis within 28 days prior to randomization.\nHas evidence of bleeding diathesis or significant coagulopathy (in the absence of coagulation).\nHas clinically significant bleeding within 28 days prior to randomization.\nIs considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical disorder, nonmalignant systemic disease or active, uncontrolled infection. Examples include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3 months) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, extensive interstitial bilateral lung disease on HRCT scan or any psychiatric disorder that prohibits obtaining informed consent.\n\nHas 1 or more conditions that, in the opinion of the treating physician, make the participant ineligible for treatment with bevacizumab. These conditions may include:\n\nUncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] >150 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] >100 mm Hg) or a history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy\nHistory of nephrotic syndrome or moderate proteinuria\nHistory of gastrointestinal perforation\nHistory of non-gastrointestinal fistula formation\nHistory of possible reversible encephalopathy syndrome (RPLS)\nHas received prior systemic anticancer therapy (other than FOLFOX + bevacizumab induction) including investigational agents within 28 days prior to randomization. Note: Participants must have recovered from all AEs due to previous therapies to =Grade 1 or baseline. Participants with persistent alopecia or Grade =3 neuropathy may be eligible.\nHas received prior therapy with olaparib or with any other polyadenosine 5'-diphosphoribase polymerase (PARP) inhibitor.\nIs currently receiving either strong (eg, itraconazole, telithromycin, clarithromycin, protease inhibitors boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or moderate (eg, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, verapamil) inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) that cannot be discontinued for the duration of the study. The required washout period prior to randomization is 2 weeks.\nIs currently receiving either strong (phenobarbital, enzalutamide, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine and St John's Wort) or moderate (eg. bosentan, efavirenz, modafinil) inducers of CYP3A4 that cannot be discontinued for the duration of the study. The required washout period prior to randomization is 5 weeks for phenobarbital and 3 weeks for other agents.\nHas undergone major surgery within 2 weeks of randomization or has not recovered adequately from toxicities and/or complications from any major surgery prior to randomization.",

At least one exacerbation should have occurred while the patient was taking inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/long acting beta agonist (LABA)/long acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) (or LABA/LAMA if ICS is contraindicated). Moderate exacerbations are recorded by the investigator and defined as AECOPD that require either systemic corticosteroids (intramuscular, intravenous, or oral) and/or antibiotics. One of the two required moderate exacerbations has to require the use of systemic corticosteroids. Severe exacerbations are recorded by the investigator and defined as AECOPD requiring hospitalization or observation > 24 hours in emergency department/urgent care facility.\nBackground triple therapy (ICS + LABA + LAMA) for 3 months prior to randomization with a stable dose of medication for =1 month prior to Visit 1; Double therapy (LABA + LAMA) allowed if ICS is contraindicated.\nEvidence of Type 2 inflammation: Patients with blood eosinophils =300 cells/microliter at Visit 1.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nCOPD diagnosis for less than 12 months prior to randomization.\nA current diagnosis of asthma or history of asthma according to the 2018 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines or other accepted guidelines.\nSignificant pulmonary disease other than COPD (e.g., lung fibrosis, sarcoidosis, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, bronchiectasis, Churg-Strauss Syndrome etc) or another diagnosed pulmonary or systemic disease associated with elevated peripheral eosinophil counts.\nCor pulmonale, evidence of right cardiac failure.\nTreatment with oxygen of more than 12 hours per day.\nHypercapnia requiring Bi-level ventilation.\nAECOPD as defined in inclusion criteria within 4 weeks prior to screening, or during the screening period.\nRespiratory tract infection within 4 weeks prior to screening, or during the screening period.\nHistory of, or planned pneumonectomy or lung volume reduction surgery. Patients who are participating in the acute phase of a pulmonary rehabilitation program, ie, who started rehabilitation <4 weeks prior to screening (Note: patients in the maintenance phase of a rehabilitation program can be included).\nDiagnosis of a-1 anti-trypsin deficiency.\n\nThe above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.",

 "BriefSummary": "Parenteral nutrition (PN) treatment in patients with incurable cancer is understudied and the level of evidence for clinical meaningful effects is weak. The ESPEN guidelines give few specific recommendations regarding which patients with incurable cancer that should be offered PN treatment. According to the Norwegian prescription database, the use of parenteral nutrition has more than doubled in the period 2004-2015. These numbers do not separate between diagnoses and medical conditions, so the current use of medical nutrition in cancer patients in Norway is not known. The decision to initiate parenteral nutrition is taken at hospitals, whereupon the patient returns home to their respective municipalities and receives follow-up by the home care service. There are often uncertainties about the duration of treatment, as patients' clinical condition can change rapidly. One major challenge health care professionals face is to decide when to end medical nutrition therapy. Patients and relatives may experience fear that discontinuation of medical nutrition accelerates death, while health care professionals often experience that nutrition in many cases does not help and inflicts negatively on patients' condition. This makes communication concerning end of nutritional treatment between health care professionals at several health care levels, patients and their relatives challenging.\n\nThere is a need for a stronger evidence base considering the effect of medical nutrition in patients with incurable cancer. To be able to study the effect of PN treatment, more studies on clinical practice of PN treatment to patients with incurable cancer is needed. Aspects like indication for use, dosage and duration of PN treatment is poorly described in the available literature. Thus, the aim of this study is to describe indications for use of PN, duration of treatment, reasons for discontinuation, method of administration, possible benefits and complications as well as survival."

 "BriefSummary": "This study will investigate differences in platelet aggregation under basal and aspirin-treated conditions in American Indian and Alaska Native people who have extreme levels (low and high) of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs, EPA and DHA) in red blood cell membranes. The study will also determine whether or not platelet aggregation under the different conditions is modified by CYP4A11, CYP4F2, CYP4F11, PEAR1, and ACTN1 gene variation.",
"DetailedDescription": "Purpose: In this aim, the investigators will test the hypothesis that n-3 PUFAs modify aspirin anti-platelet response, by measuring and comparing three different indicators of aspirin response in individuals with extremely high and low RBC n-3 PUFA levels, under a basal state and after 1-week of once a day aspirin treatment. The three indicators are: 1) platelet TXB2 and 20-HETE concentrations; 2) platelet aggregation ex vivo (in response to external stimuli); and 3) aspirin covalent adduct of COX-1. The investigators will also test whether or not common variants in the CYP4A11, CYP4F2, CYP4F11, PEAR1 and ACTN1 genes are associated with basal and aspirin-induced changes in platelet aggregation and, in an exploratory analysis, modify the effects of n-3 PUFAs on aspirin response.\n\nProcedures and Population: Investigators from the University of Montana, Southcentral Foundation and Oregon Health & Science University will recruit a total of 150 individuals (50 at each site) to participate in the study. At each performance site, the participants recruited will represent 25 individuals with high and 25 individuals with low RBC n-3 PUFA concentrations. After providing written consent, each study participant will be screened for medical history and clinical lab testing to ensure good health and good liver, kidney and blood test parameters. If found to be eligible, each participant will provide 12-hour fasted (overnight) blood samples for isolation of plasma, platelets, lymphocytes, and red blood cells. A separate blood sample will be collected into a citrate treated tube for platelet aggregation testing using the PFA-100 platform. Isolated blood fractions will be stored at -80°C.\n\nAfter baseline sampling, each participant will be given six doses of aspirin (80 mg/day for 6 days) and instructed to take one dose daily at approximately 9 am. On the day after the last aspirin dose, the participant will provide blood samples for repeated platelet aggregation testing, platelet lipid analysis and measurement of aspirin covalent adduct to COX-1, and a spot urine sample to confirm aspirin consumption by testing for salicylate. For 24 hours prior to platelet aggregation testing, study participants will be asked to avoid foods that could lead to spurious test results (eg, chocolate, tea, coffee, cola, red wine, beer, tomato, grapes, grape juice, orange and cranberry juices, as well as traditional wild foods that include berries, plant roots, plant greens etc).\n\nAnalytical Methods: Whole blood, point of care, platelet aggregation testing will be performed using the automated PFA-100 instrument. Performance by research personnel will be compared head-head to clinical testing services at each site, as a quality control measure. In each test setting, the investigators will obtain results in duplicate for both collagen/epinephrine and collagen/ADP cartridges. The investigators will also measure platelet TXB2, 20-HETE and AA concentrations, by LC-MS/MS. In addition, the investigators will develop and employ a method to quantify theaspirin covalent adduct of COX-1 in isolated platelets from study participants.\n\nStatistical Methods: For each study population, and subgroups with extreme RBC n-3 PUFA phenotypes, the investigators will use linear regression models with robust standard errors to identify significant differences in the mean absolute platelet aggregation test results under basal and aspirin-treated conditions (primary outcome), as well as the post-treatment-to-baseline change in platelet aggregation. Heterogeneity between pairs of extreme phenotypes subgroups will be accounted for by including sex, age, BMI and platelet count as covariates in the regression model. Sample size calculation for each performance site (n = 25 per n-3 PUFA subgroup) was based on having power of at least 0.8 for detecting a difference in mean platelet aggregation between the two extreme (0-10 and 90-100 percentiles) n-3 PUFA subgroups under basal conditions, at a significance level of 0.05. As a secondary level of analysis, for each subgroup of the extreme RBC n-3 PUFA phenotypes, the investigators will also compare mean platelet TXB2 and 20-HETE concentrations under basal and aspirin-treated conditions, as well as the post-treatment-to-baseline change. Finally, a third level of analysis will involve testing each study population for a difference in the extent of aspirin adduct to COX-1 between groups with extreme RBC n-3 PUFA phenotypes. The investigators will test for associations between platelet aggregation test results and biochemical measures of platelet activation, each study population separately and in aggregate.\n\nThe investigators will use linear regression models to test for an association between common CYP4A11,CYP4F2, CYP4F11, PEAR1 and ACTN1 genotypes and the mean absolute platelet aggregation test results under basal and aspirin-treated conditions, as well as the post-treatment-to-baseline change in platelet aggregation. In an exploratory analysis, the investigators will apply Linear Mixed Effects (LME) models to the combined pre- and post-treatment dataset to test for associations with n-3 PUFAs group and drug effects, as well as to identify any modifications of those effects by CYP4A11, CYP4F2, CYP4F11, PEAR1 and ACTN1 variation by including and testing for significant interaction effects in the models. The investigators will include random effects in the LME to account for potential heterogeneity in each of the populations."

 "BriefSummary": "Amyloidosis by mutation of the transthyretin gene (ATTRh) is part of a group of diseases in which the deposit of structurally abnormal proteins (amyloid fibrils) affects multiple organs such as: liver, kidney, eyes, nervous system, gastrointestinal tract and heart, and, finally, it increases the morbidity and mortality of affected patients. This deposit in the myocardium is manifested syndromically as heart failure with preserved or slightly reduced systolic function, and important diastolic dysfunction. The analysis of diastolic function comprises two components: the assessment of active relaxation, dependent on preload and afterload, and the assessment of the passive properties of the tissue - its hardness or rigidity. Myocardial stiffness represents an important parameter for diagnosis and prognosis, but its evaluation is not included in conventional echocardiography. Cardiac elastography has recently been proposed as a non-invasive diagnostic modality to assess myocardial stiffness."

"InterventionDescription": "The elastographic technique by ultrasound (USE), shear waves or shear wave elastography (SWE), quantitatively evaluates tissue stiffness by mapping the propagation of acoustic waves (shear waves), in a non-invasive manner and without emission of ionizing radiation. Their speeds are tracked by the ultrasound equipment after tissue deformation occurs, generated by pulses of acoustic radiation (ARFI) of the transducer itself. Assuming the correlation between tissue stiffness and increased acoustic propagation speeds, it is possible to describe mathematically the elasticity of tissues by measuring specific acoustic waves.",

 "BriefSummary": "The need for exploration of more definitive and cost effective non-arthroplasty treatments of osteoarthritis (OA) has been demonstrated by the orthopedic and health economic research.\n\nEmbolotherapy of neovessels associated with OA joints has been shown to be promising in patients with knee OA. There is a need for level one evidence drawn from randomized clinical trials to prove the safety, feasibility and efficacy of knee embolotherapy compared to standard of care.\n\nThis randomized pilot study will assign 10 patients with mild-moderate OA to undergo geniculate artery embolization plus standard of care (defined in this study as: physical therapy and oral anti-inflammatory medications, with a maximum of 1 joint injection at the time of enrollment) and 10 patients to receive only medical standard of care (also having had a maximum of 1 joint injection prior to enrollment). The goal of this pilot study is to obtain preliminary estimates of safety and efficacy of embolotherapy to provide sustained symptom control and modify disease progression in patients with mild to moderate knee OA.",
"DetailedDescription": "This is a single center, two-arm, open label, pilot study to assess feasibility and safety and obtain a preliminary estimate of efficacy of geniculate artery embolization in reducing pain compared to a control group undergoing conservative presurgical management. The 20 patients will be randomly divided into two groups of 10 in 1:1 allocation. One group will have embolization of the geniculate artery branches and standard of care while the other will have only the standard care. Following the completion of the 10 participants in each arm, a safety and data review will be undertaken (Visit 4 in the GAE group and Visit 2 of the SOC). The data will be assessed regarding the trends between the groups as they relate to KOOS/WOMAC pain scale, MRI / Xray evaluation of OA, and presence of inflammatory biomarkers."

 "BriefSummary": "The investigators developed a portable pressure measuring device using silicon piezoresistive pressure sensors. As PicoPress® is the most accurate (i.e., lowest variation and error) manometric sensor for pressure measurement, the investigators used it to compare and examine the accuracy of the proposed device regarding in vitro pressure measurements. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of pressure garment therapy using proposed device with objective data obtained with a randomized within wound comparison. Pressure measurements were acquired through a readout circuit consisting of an analog-to-digital converter, a microprocessor, and a Bluetooth transmission module for wireless data transmission to an external device. The mean pressure values measured by the sensors were compared to those obtained from PicoPress®. This was a double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial of patients with hypertrophic scars. In the pressure monitoring group, garment pressures were monitored using the portable pressure measuring device, and the compression garment was adjusted so that the pressure was maintained at the therapeutic range of 15 - 25 mmHg. In the control group, non-surgical standard treatment of burn scars except for pressure monitoring was performed in the same manner.",

In the control group, non-surgical standard treatment of burn scars except for pressure monitoring was performed in the same manner. To evaluate the effect of a pressure monitoring device, the investigators compared the skin test results (thickness, melanin, erythema, TEWL, and skin elasticity levels) between the two groups, from baseline measures immediately before the treatment and measures immediately after 2 months. The participants were made comfortable and acclimatized to room conditions. Room temperature was maintained at 20-25'C and relative humidity at 40-50 %. In the supine position, skin properties were measured. The thickness was measured with a ultrasonic wave equipment (128 BW1 Medison, Korea). Mexameter® (MX18, Courage-Khazaka Electronics GmbH, Germany) was used to measure melanin levels and the severity of erythema. The higher values indicating a darker and redder skin. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was measured with a Tewameter® (Courage-Khazaka Electronic GmbH, Germany), which is used for evaluating water evaporation. Elasticity was measured using Cutometer SEM 580® (Courage-Khazaka Electronic GmbH, Cologne, Germany), which applies negative pressure (450 mbar) on the skin. The numeric values (mm) of the skin's distortion is presented as the elasticity. Two seconds of negative pressure of 450 mbar is followed by 2 s of recess, and this consists of a complete cycle. Three measurement cycles were conducted, and the average values were obtained. The parameters consist of the following biomechanical skin properties: distenstibility, elasticity, and viscoelasticity. Distensibility means the length of total displacement from initial postion at maximum negative pressure. Gross elasticity means the ability of the skin to return to its initial position following displacement. Biologic elasticity means the ratio of immediate retraction to total displacement. Viscoelasticity means the ratio of delayed distension of immediate distension. Outcome measurements and data analyses were performed by a trained and blinded outcome assessor who was not involved in the intervention. Possible complications (pain, ecchymosis, pain, skin abrasion, and swelling) were observed."

 "BriefSummary": "The loss of muscle mass post-surgery confounds recovery efforts and leads to a delay in patient's ability to return to activities. Although the use of testosterone in aging and chronic muscle loss has been investigated, this study could prove short-term use of testosterone efficacious in preventing muscle atrophy due to surgery. We hypothesize that by bracketing an indexed knee surgery with testosterone undecanoate injections, post-surgical quadriceps muscle loss may be minimized. Determination of the effect of intra-muscular (IM) testosterone injections in preventing quadriceps muscle loss are measured by serial MRI and manual measurements of quadriceps cross-section.",
"DetailedDescription": "This is an in vivo study using serial IM testosterone undeconate injections in participants undergoing knee surgery with limited weight bearing post-operatively which includes partial/total knee replacement, ACL reconstruction/revision, meniscal allograft transplantation and articular cartilage paste grafting. The design is a randomized, controlled, double blind, longitudinal study of intra-muscular injections of testosterone versus saline control. Pre-operative and post-operative assessments will include: serial MRIs and manual measurements of quadriceps cross-section and quality of life survey, SF-36. Blood analysis will be performed for therapeutic assessment and safety. The participant will receive two testosterone undeconate injections, once during their pre-operative visit and once during their 1 month visit. Timing of assessments will be pre-operative, 1-4 days post-operative and 1, 3, and 6 months. Measurement of the control group versus experimental group at all time points may identify differences in participant response to testosterone injections."

 "BriefSummary": "Crohn's disease is an inflammatory disorder that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Some patients still experience persistent diarrhea or other symptoms such as abdominal pain even when their Crohn's disease is in remission. Diarrhea and/or abdominal pain that is not responsive to standard therapies can significantly affect a patient's quality of life and ability to work. The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of the drug ranolazine in reducing Crohn's disease-associated diarrhea and other symptoms. Ranolazine is approved by the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) for chronic angina (a heart condition). This study is investigating if ranolazine could be used in the setting of Crohn's disease."

 "BriefSummary": "It is planned to conduct a study of nitric oxide metabolites (nitrates and nitrites), L-arginine, arginase-1, and asymmetric dimethylarginine in patients with bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, followed by observation to assess the prognosis of the disease.",
"DetailedDescription": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchial asthma have a leading position among respiratory diseases. A significant contribution to the clinical picture and long-term prognosis is made by exacerbations of COPD, which makes it relevant to search for methods for their prediction and prevention (GOLD, 2018). According to the global initiative on bronchial asthma (GINA), bronchial asthma is characterized by high heterogeneity and the existence of many phenotypes and endotypes, which makes it relevant to use personalized medicine methods in patient management and, in particularly, the search for new biomarkers of asthma. Currently, in clinical practice, some biomarkers of obstructive lung diseases are widely used. Among them there are the level of eosinophils in the blood and sputum, the level of immunoglobulin E and the exhaled fraction of nitric oxide (FeNO). Obstructive lung diseases are characterized by persistent inflammation in the airways, which is accompanied by the manifestation of elements of systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, which is associated with an altered release of vasoactive mediators, one of them is nitric oxide (NO). NO is a powerful vasodilator that is synthesized from L-arginine using the enzyme NO synthase (NOS). The NO molecule has small lifetime from 3 to 30 s, that's why the search for biomarkers with a more stable lifetime is relevant. Some of them it's nitric oxide metabolites, such as nitrates (NO3-), nitrites (NO2-), S-nitrosothiols, 3-nitrotyrosine. Nitrates and nitrites, which are metabolites of nitric oxide, may be of interest as one of the promising biochemical markers reflecting NO metabolism in the human body. Earlier in our study, the relationship between the plasma level of nitric oxide metabolites and the severity of bronchial asthma was shown, which may be a prerequisite for further study of the components of the nitric oxide system as potential biomarkers of bronchial obstructive diseases (Shakhanov et al., 2017).\n\nA promising direction in the search for biomarkers related to the nitric oxide system is the study of L-arginine, which acts as a substrate in the reaction of NO formation (North et al., 2010). The bioavailability of L-arginine for NO synthases determines the activity of formation of nitric oxide in the respiratory tract, as evidenced by the effect of inhaled L-arginine on the level of exhaled fraction of nitric oxide (Kharitonov et al., 1995). Earlier, in a US study, 26 patients with bronchial asthma showed a significant decrease in plasma L-arginine levels compared with healthy volunteers (Morris et al., 2004), and laboratory animal models showed that a decrease in L-arginine levels leads to airway hyperreactivity (Maarsingh et al., 2009). Currently, a number of pilot clinical interventional studies have been carried out in which the administration of L-arginine improved the manifestations of bronchial asthma in some patients, but did not change the frequency of exacerbations in the total sample of patients (Kenyon et al., 2011). This indicates the possible existence of an endotype of bronchial asthma associated with impaired functioning of the nitric oxide system, and makes it promising to study the level of L-arginine in the blood as a potential biomarker of obstructive lung diseases.\n\nIn addition to studying nitric oxide metabolites, substances that affect the formation of NO should be considered as potential biomarkers of the disease. One such substance is arginase, under the influence of which L-arginine is converted into L-ornithine and urea. In humans, two isoenzymes of arginase, arginase 1 and arginase 2, have been identified, which differ in cellular location and tissue distribution (Wu G, Morris SM, 1998). Both arginase enzymes are expressed in the airways and can be found in endothelial and epithelial cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, and smooth muscle cells of the respiratory tract (Bergeron C, Boulet L, 2007). Further metabolism of L-ornithine leads to the formation of polyamines and L-proline, which are involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as in the production of collagen (W.Xu, SA Comhair, 2017). Scientists have shown that increased arginase activity in the airways contributes to airway obstruction and hyperreactivity by decreasing the availability substrate for NOS (H. Maarsingh, J. Zaagsma, 2009). As a result, the production of NO decreases and superoxides form, which react with NO to form peroxynitrite, thereby increasing airway contractility and inflammation. In addition, increased airway arginase activity leads to an increase in L-ornithine production, which potentially contributes to airway remodeling due to stimulation of cell proliferation and collagen formation (H. Maarsingh, J. Zaagsma, 2009).\n\nThe metabolism of L-arginine depends not only on arginase, but also on the methyltransferase enzyme, which methylates L-arginine residues, which undergo proteolysis with the formation of asymmetric and symmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA and SDMA). These amino acids inhibit NOS activity, since ADMA is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme, while SDMA is a competitor to L-arginine transport. Serum ADMA and SDMA, as well as L-arginine concentrations increase with COPD and increase further with the development of exacerbation (Ruzsics I, Nagy L, 2016). It is important to note that the concentration of ADMA in blood serum is probably an independent risk factor for long-term mortality from all causes in obstructive lung diseases (Vogeli A, Ottiger M, 2017) and is associated with increased airway resistance (Tajti G, Geszteli R, 2017). In recent years, several studies have been conducted examining the association of ADMA with obstructive lung diseases (Calabrese et al., 2015). Earlier the association of ADMA with the development of obstructive lung diseases (Scott et al., 2011), airway resistance (Scott, Grasemann, 2013) and indicators of the function of external respiration in patients with obstructive lung diseases (Winnica et al., 2017) was shown.\n\nThus, there are prerequisites for studying the components of the nitric oxide system, such as metabolites of nitric oxide, L-arginine, arginase, and asymmetric dimethylarginine, as a biomarker of obstructive lung diseases. Based on this, we plan to study of nitric oxide metabolites (nitrates and nitrites), L-arginine, arginase-1, and asymmetric dimethylarginine in patients with bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, followed by observation to assess the prognosis of the disease.\n\nThe study is aimed at studying the clinical value of the nitric oxide synthesis modulators (L-arginine, arginase-1 and asymmetric dimethylarginine) in patients with bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as assessing their effect on the prognosis and the course of diseases .\n\nThe study objectives is\n\nTo assess the levels of modulators of the synthesis of nitric oxide (L-arginine, arginase-1 and asymmetric dimethylarginine) in the blood of patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and their relationship with the clinical course of the disease.\nTo evaluate the clinical value of the ratio of the levels of modulators of the synthesis of nitric oxide (L-arginine, arginase-1 and asymmetric dimethylarginine) and the level of metabolites of nitric oxide (nitrates and nitrites) in patients with bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nTo assess the possibility of using the determination of the levels of modulators of nitric oxide synthesis to predict the course of obstructive lung diseases and prevent the development of exacerbations of bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nTo assess the possibility of developing personalized treatment regimens for obstructive lung diseases, based on the assesment of the levels of modulators of the synthesis of nitric oxide (L-arginine, arginase-1 and asymmetric dimethylarginine) in the blood of patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\nIt is planned to conduct a prospective case-control study in the three study groups. To all patients will be performed: general clinical examination; Test of Adherence to Inhalers; clinical and biochemical analysis of the blood; spirometry; assesment of the level of nitric oxide metabolites in serum using the photocolorimetric method in Griss reaction; assesment of the level of L-arginine, arginase-1 and asymmetric dimethylarginine in serum by enzyme immunoassay using the laboratory kit Immundiagnostik (Germany). At the second phase of the study, lasting 2 years, the prognostic capabilities of assesment the levels of modulators of nitric oxide synthesis will be evaluated using a combined endpoint, included increase in level of basis therapy, exacerbation, hospitalisation and mors associated with Asthma and COPD."

 "BriefSummary": "The objective of this study is to compare, through a multicentric randomized trial, the impact of two pH values in the embryo culture medium on the clinical results of In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) process and especially the impact on live birth delivery rate.",
"DetailedDescription": "Despite progress in Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART), the livebirth rate per oocyte retrieval during In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) remain relatively low (15 à 25%). This is in part due to the sensitivity of the preimplantation embryo to its environment. Indeed, there is growing evidence that culture conditions during IVF are critical not only for the development of pre- and post-implantation embryo, but also for long-term health effects; and numerous animal data suggest the importance of pH control in the IVF culture medium. Maintaining the intercellular pH (pHi) is one of the vital roles of embryo homeostasis since pHi regulates many cellular processes. Indeed, variations in pHi can affect embryonic development. Although the embryo has biochemical systems to regulate its pHi, these systems can be overtaken. Under the conditions of IVF embryo culture, the extracellular pH (pHe) in a culture medium is the result of a balance between CO2 concentration in the incubator and bicarbonate concentration in the culture medium (determined by the medium manufacturer). The recommendations of the manufacturers of embryo culture media are to maintain a pHe slightly higher (generally between 7.2 and 7.4) than the pHi (estimated between 7.1 to 7.2) to compensate for the acidification due to cell metabolism. However, as the pH scale is logarithmic, a pHe variation of 7.2 to 7.4 corresponds to a decrease in the concentration of H+ ions by a factor of 1.6 in the medium. Actually, there is no clinical data to know what is the ideal pH to apply to a culture medium during IVF.\n\nThis is a clinical study comparing two pH values in the culture medium of embryos obtained by IVF, randomized, multicentric (3 centers), patient-blinded, in groups parallel to the ratio 1: 1. IVF-ICSI will be performed according to the usual procedure and the day of the oocyte puncture, the embryologist will proceed to the 1: 1 randomization: culture of the oocytes and embryos in the culture medium with a pH at 7.38 ± 0.02 or a pH at 7.22 ± 0.02.\n\nIn case of pregnancy after embryo transfer, patients will be followed until delivery."

An American observational study in 2013 showed that the total average annual adjusted direct medical cost/person for DPN patients was $4,841, and the total average annual adjusted indirect medical cost/person was $9,730. A retrospective study in the United States in 2015 showed that the total annual direct medical cost per person for diabetes was $6,632, DPN ($12,492), DPN ($27,931), and severe DPN ($30,755) were 4.6 times higher than those for patients with diabetes alone. According to the 2015 European survey, the total annual direct medical cost per person for DPN patients in the United Kingdom was €2,963 (£2,511), of which 40% was used for hospitalization.\n\nAt present, there are no studies on the population epidemiology, depression and drug use of DPN in China. This study mainly investigates the above problems."

 "BriefSummary": "This observational study aims to collect detailed clinical information on confirmed or suspected patients of COVID-19 treated in hospitals from Meta State, Colombia. The objectives are:\n\nTo establish the characteristics of patients and healthcare workers treated with COVID-19.\nTo assess previous predisposing morbidity.\nTo detail clinical factors associated with complications.\nTo profile clinical indicators for severity and outcomes.",
"DetailedDescription": "Hospital database and clinical charts in an electronic format of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 will be reviewed to include in the study. Multiple centers from the eastern Colombian prairies caring for this population will participate to provide an understanding of the behavior of the epidemic and accurate clinical comprehension of the disease. Healthcare centers involved in providing an evaluation of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 will be invited to participate.\n\nThe study will focus on the routine or new treatment strategies provided and a large population of patients analyzed would be desirable. It will allow identifying the most relevant factors associated with clinical outcomes, complications, and prognosis, with an appropriate statistical methodology for the analysis of observational nature.\n\nVariables of individuals assisted will be recorded as well as the end results, such as baseline characteristics of individuals and disease, and main outcomes such as mortality, need for ICU attention, mechanical ventilation, and length of stay.\n\nThese results will be used to promote an improvement in the quality of care and individual and cluster decisions in the region."

"DetailedDescription": "Overall study design\n\nThis is a phase II randomized study of convalescent plasma for the treatment of non-immune individuals with COVID-19 infection at high risk of complications.\nSubjects will be considered as having completed the study after 2 months (+/- 5) days, unless consent withdrawal or death occurs first.\nSubjects will be randomized to receiving convalescent plasma or best supportive care.\nPatients randomized to best supportive care may receive plasma should they require hospitalization for progression of COVID-19 disease.\nThe final analysis will be conducted once the last subject completes the 2-month visit or withdraws from the study.\n\nA total of 306 subjects will be recruited, 153 for each arm. If a patient in the best supportive care arm requires hospitalization, the patient will be eligible to receive convalescent plasma if requested and/or deemed medically appropriate by the admitting physician.\n\nOverall study duration\n\nThe study begins when the first subject (donor or recipient) signs the informed consent. The study will end once the last enrolled subject completes the study (likely a recipient).\nThe expected duration of the study is approximately 12 months."

 "BriefSummary": "The clinical investigation aims to generate clinical data to support the use of Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT) in clinical practice, its inclusion in diagnostic guidelines and to support its reimbursement, specifically to\n\nFurther validate the application with respect to including ulcerative colitis patients\nPrepare a study protocol for large-scale clinical validation study in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)\nSuccessfully execute the clinical validation study",
"DetailedDescription": "The clinical investigation, EUPHORIA, will pave the way to establish Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT) technology for the non-invasive assessment of intestinal inflammation in patients. EUPHORIA will enable commercialization of the technology by finalizing technical improvements that will increase diagnostic outcome beyond what has been shown in a first feasibility study, will improve usability, prepare CE marking for the new device and validate clinical results in a large clinical investigation.\n\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic condition, posing significant burden to patients and health care systems. Patients suffer from a relapsing course of intestinal inflammation, and to date, there is no satisfying noninvasive diagnostic modality for monitoring disease activity. In a recent clinical study conducted by University Hospital Erlangen, MSOT, a technology developed by iThera Medical (ITM), has proven to be superior in diagnostic performance to other procedures."

 "BriefSummary": "The aim of this study is to investigate physiological characteristics, body composition and performance indicators among youth soccer players of four age categories (U-12, U-14, U-16, and U-18). Participants will undergo assessment of their body weight, body height and percent of body fat as well as performance testing including flexibility, strength, vertical jump, speed, repeated sprint ability, agility, dribbling and endurance.",
"DetailedDescription": "This study aims at investigating anthropometric, body composition and performance indicators among male youth soccer players. The study will be conducted prior to the preparation period. Initially, participants and their parents (for those under 18 years) will be informed about the benefits, risks and discomforts associated with the study and will provide a written consent. Participants will be instructed to refrain from strenuous exercise for at least 48 hours prior to testing and they will be also asked to consume their normal diet. Prior to testing all participants will be familiarized with testing procedures and specific test. Body weight will be measured on a seca beam balance. Participants' height will be measured by using a fixed stadiometer and the percent body fat will be calculated with bioelectrical impedance analysis. Flexibility will be assessed by using the sit and reach test and the lower body explosive strength will be determined through vertical jump testing (squat jump and counter movement jump without arm swing). Knee flexor and extensor strength will be assessed on an isokinetic dynamometer. Sprint performance will be assessed from a standing start over by infrared photocells with participants running 10m and 30m as fast as they can. The repeated sprint ability will be tested by using linear sprint test including 5 maximum sprints of 30 meters with a 25-second recovery period in-between. Maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) will be determined by open-circuit spirometry via breath-by-breath analysis during a graded exercise test to exhaustion on a treadmill. Furthermore, participants will be evaluated in agility by using the short dribbling test and the ability to recover after repeated intense exercise through the YO-YO Intermittent Recovery test 1 (only for u-16 and U-18 groups)."

 "BriefSummary": "This is a pilot phase, open label, non-randomized study for the treatment of ARDS in patients infected with COVID-19. Subjects will be enrolled and treated with one dose of mesenchymal stem cells and follow-up will occur 90 days post-treatment.",
"DetailedDescription": "A Study of Mesenchymal Stem Cells as a treatment in Patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome caused by COVID-19 is a pilot phase, open label, non-randomized study, with a single study center.\n\nThe current pandemic caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 has lead to a health care crisis affecting hospitals, hospital workers and health care structure globally. Many countries are dealing with a disrupted infrastructure in health care and imminent economic downfall to an extent that has not been seen in recent years. COVID-19 has lead to a large number of deaths in several countries, and Mexico has not been an exception. Availability of supplies, hospital space and equipment for mechanical ventilation are running critically low, and it has been a challenge for hospitals coping with severe clinical symptoms in COVID-19. This disease is characterized by pneumonia, fever, cough and occasional diarrhea, and the severity has been largely attributed to the high affinity of the virus to Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the main receptor, and the Type II Transmembrane Serine Protease TMPRSS2 as the main host protease that mediates S protein activation on primary target cells in the lung and small intestine.\n\nMany agencies and professional societies are working worldwide in developing treatment guidelines to care for patients with COVID-19, since the present treatments are supportive but not yet curative, therefore these guidelines are based on scientific evidence and expert opinion, the use of an array of drugs approved for other indications, as well as multiple investigational agents that are being studied. Lately, Remdesivir, a novel small-molecule adenine nucleotide analogue antiviral drug that has shown efficacy against Ebola virus in rhesus monkeys has shown improvement in patients with oxygen support. The focus of the research for a cure of COVID-19 has been centered on the individual's response in an immunological context, where an over activation of the immune response can cause a production of a large quantity of inflammatory molecules resulting in a cytokine storm with severe physiological consequences. The cytokine storm induces an increase in inflammatory proteins that results in edema, improper oxygen exchange, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), other organ damage and secondary infection. In recent studies, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have proven to decrease the hyper inflammatory response in the lungs, leading to a steady recovery in patients with ARDS. The use of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) may prove a potential effective measure for the treatment of the cytokine storm induced by COVID-19.\n\nA step forward in a treatment strategy for the novel virus infection in humans would be critical for treating COVID-19 and especially ARDS-induced severe pneumonia, which is currently depleting resources around the world. Because efforts to control lung injury via pharmacological agents have been unsuccessful, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapy is being investigated, based on the characteristics of MSCs to self-renew in a limitless manner and their multipotency.\n\nFurthermore, MSC-based therapies have demonstrated in the past of having sufficient promising effects in experimental treatment of ARDS via inhibition of alveolar collapse, collagen accumulation, and cell apoptosis in lung tissue. Recent studies found that administrating allogeneic MSCs in patients with ARDS resulted in no pre-specified adverse events, including hypoxemia, cardiac arrhythmia, and ventricular tachycardia. MSCs are currently attracting interest due to source potential, a high proliferation rate, and a painless procedure that is free of ethical issues. Selection of a starting dose of approximately 100 million cells has been chosen to approximate the standard dosage of cells employed in prior clinical studies. This dosage may be adjusted depending on the data generated during the conduction of the study.\n\nMSCs play a positive role mainly in two ways, namely immunomodulatory effects and differentiation abilities. MSCs can secrete many types of cytokines by paracrine secretion or make direct interactions with immune cells, leading to immunomodulation. The immunomodulatory effects of MSCs are triggered further by the activation of TLR receptor in MSCs, which is stimulated by pathogen-associated molecules such as LPS or double-stranded RNA from virus, like the HCoV-19.\n\nThere are many pilot studies conducted with MSC transplantation to explore their therapeutic potential for HCoV-19 infected patients, in many of them the pulmonary function and symptoms of patients were significantly improved days after MSC transplantation. Thus, in this study we intend to prove the intravenous transplantation of MSCs as safe and effective for treatment in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for patients in severe condition.\n\nPrimary Objective: To determine the feasibility and safety of intravenously administered MSCs in patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nTo assess preliminary response in respiratory performance in patients with ARDS.\n\nTo assess overall survival of patients. To determine mortality rate at 14 days post treatment. To assess clinical and radiological improvements in patients.\n\nNumber of Subjects to be studied: 10\n\nEndpoints\n\nPrimary Endpoint:\n\nEvaluate Respiratory distress symptoms based on Berlin definition (RR; Oxygen saturation at rest; Arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / Fraction of inspiration O2 (FiO2)).\n\nDetermine the degree of ground-glass opacity and pneumonia infiltration in imaging studies (X-ray or CT).\n\nEvaluate clinical improvement based on APACHE II Score. Determine mortality rate at 2 weeks post treatment.\n\nSecondary Endpoints:\n\nAdverse events related to MSC infusion (description, timing, grade, seriousness, and relatedness) Hematological decompensation (based on CBC, SQ and metabolic panels) Objective response rate Progression free survival, overall survival, and best overall response rate Determine if any infusion reactions/toxicity occurs\n\nClinical and radiological parameters will be assessed at Baseline, 2, 4 and 14 day post-treatment, and there will be a 3 month follow-up by telephone contact."

 "BriefSummary": "This study is a multi-center prospective cohort study. We will continuously recruit subjects with silent cerebrovascular disease aged 60 to 85 years from Shanghai and Guizhou. Data including demographic characteristics, medical history, other concomitant diseases, neurological function assessments, laboratory examinations, imaging examinations, and other clinical data and health economics survey responses will be collected from all subjects.\n\nAt baseline, all subjects will undergo gait assessment using the intelligent system and cognitive function scale assessment by clinicians. According to the intelligent gait results, the subjects will be divided into normal and abnormal gait groups. All subjects will be observed naturally for 1 year, and all medical behaviors will be recorded. All subjects will be interviewed by telephone for the occurrence of vascular events and changes in medical behaviors at half a year after enrollment and followed up at 1 year after enrollment, including gait evaluation using the intelligent system and cognitive function scale evaluation by clinicians. During the follow-up period, patients can visit the hospital for follow-up at any time when their condition changes.",
"DetailedDescription": "The neurological function of all subjects was assessed based on the following tests under the guidance of a physician. The timed up-and-go test was used to evaluate the subjects' gait function, requiring them to stand up from their seat and walk straight forward for 3 meters, turn around, walk straight back to the chair, and then sit down again. Using simple cognitive evaluation (Mini-Cognitive Assessment) screening of the subjects' memory and executive function, the participants will first be asked to remember three unrelated words and immediately repeat the three words; they will then be asked to draw a clock marked with the numbers and pointers, and eventually recall the three words. The verbal function of the subjects will be assessed using the verbal retelling items in the MMSE and Montreal Cognitive Assessment, asking the subjects to clearly repeat \"44 stone lions,\" \"I only know Zhang Liang came to help today,\" and \"the cat always hid under the sofa when the dog was in the room.\" Through the camera image data record, the intelligent system uses the built-in intelligent algorithm for intelligent video gait recognition and neural networks based on depth interpretation automation and automatic access to the subjects' gait characteristics (stand-up time, turnaround time, stride length, step velocity, stride length, step width, etc.), language features (pronunciation, intonation, word order, language accuracy, language fluency, etc.), and clock features."

 "BriefSummary": "This is a phase III randomized clinical trial of definitive radiotherapy plus EGFR blocker nimotuzumab versus radiotherapy plus cisplatin(CCRT) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients with favorable response to induction chemotheray(IC), determining whether radiotherapy combined with nimotuzumab was non-inferior to CCRT and may provide new evidence for individualized comprehensive treatment of locoregionally advanced NPC.",
"DetailedDescription": "Currently, NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) guidelines recommend induction chemotherapy combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy as IIA level-evidenced treatment for locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (stage II-IVa). However, although induction chemotherapy combined with cisplatin based concurrent radiotherapy (CCRT) can significantly improve the survival of patients, the side effects during radiotherapy are more serious.\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that with a cut-off point of 1500 copies/mL, NPC patients could be segregated into a low-risk subgroup and a high-risk subgroup. Besides, our previous results showed that patients with plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA= 0 copy/mL and complete response/partial response (CR/PR) after induction chemotherapy had a significantly lower risk of disease progression than patients with plasma EBV DNA>0 copy/mL and stable disease /progressive disease (SD/PD),according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). As for these low-risk and chemotheray sensitive patients, it can be considered to reduce the current standard treatment intensity without affecting the survival rate of patients, which reduces the side effects of patients and improve the their life qualities.\n\nEpidermal growth factor (EGFR) is an important therapeutic target for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. A retrospective study suggested that there was no significant difference in the 3-year overall survival between NPC patients who received nimotuzumab / cetuximab plus radiotherapy and those who received standard CCRT. Besides, in terms of hepatorenal toxicity, anti-EGFR drugs showed better safety compared with traditional cisplatin chemotherapy. Up to now, randomized clinical trial about the application of nimotuzumab after IC is still limited.\n\nThis is a phase III randomized clinical trial of definitive radiotherapy plus EGFR blocker nimotuzumab versus radiotherapy plus cisplatin for NPC patients with favorable response after IC, determining whether radiotherapy combined with nimotuzumab was non-inferior to CCRT after IC and may provide new evidence for individualized comprehensive treatment of locoregionally advanced NPC."

 "BriefSummary": "Testosterone is the principal androgen produced by the male testes. Hypogonadism is the result of inadequate production of testosterone by the Leydig cells of the testes and is reflected by serum concentrations of testosterone of < 300 ng/dL, with no discernible diurnal pattern. The etiology of hypogonadism may be primary or secondary. The treatment of males with primary, and in some cases, secondary Hypogonadism includes administration of testosterone.\n\nTestim® and Fortesta® are topical creams that when applied daily help to increase the total testosterone levels in the blood through skin absorption. Aveed® is an injectable form of testosterone treatment and subjects randomized to this treatment arm will receive 3 injections over the course of 16 weeks.\n\nThis study is designed to evaluate the effect on blood pressure of approved testosterone products (Testim®, Fortesta®, and Aveed®) after 16 weeks of therapy using 24-hour Ambulatory blood pressure (ABPM) to reveal shifts in BP levels."

 "BriefSummary": "Objective: To analyze the survival of patients with a reduction in the number of resected LN in patients submitted to neoadjuvant and total excision of the mesorectum with rectal cancer.\n\nExpected results:\n\nSurvival rate between patients Complete Pathologic Response with less than 12 LN and 12 or more LN.\n\nTo determine the difference in survival between patients with less than 12 LN in complete versus incomplete response.",
"DetailedDescription": "According to the International Union Against Cancer a minimum of 12 lymph nodes (LN) should be obtained in the surgical specimen for colorectal cancer staging. Recent studies have reported that the use of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (QRN) may result in failure to obtain the minimum number of LN in the piece in 30-52% of patients. Objective: To analyze the survival of patients with a reduction in the number of resected LN in patients submitted to neoadjuvant and total excision of the mesorectum with rectal cancer. Patients and methods: From January 2013 to January 2015, patients with rectal cancer were submitted to QRN (5-FU and 5040 Gys) followed by total excision of mesorectum with ligation of the inferior mesenteric vessels in their roots. Patients with T3, T4 and / or N + staging that were up to 10 cm from the anal border were included. Patients whose treatment with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was incomplete or who had significant delays in re- staging and / or performing the surgery were excluded. All were staged by rectal examination, colonoscopy, chest and abdominal CT, and pelvic MRI, and also re-staged 8 weeks after neoadjuvant termination, operated and submitted to total excision of the mesorectum. The patients were divided into 4 groups: a) Incomplete pathological response with less than 12 LN. b) Incomplete pathological response with 12 or more LN. c) Complete pathological response with less than 12 LN. d) Complete pathological response with 12 or more LN. The possible variables related to the number of LN obtained and related to general and disease free survival were studied.\n\nExpected results:\n\nTo analyze the survival rate between patients Complete Pathologic Response with less than 12 LN and 12 or more LN. To determine the difference in survival between patients with less than 12 LN in complete versus incomplete response. Demonstrate that patients with complete pathologic response and less than 12 LN have a disease-free survival equal to or better than patients with 12 LN or more."

 "BriefSummary": "Rationale: Despite the availability of effective treatment to reach symptom control, nearly half of the asthma patients remain inadequately controlled. There is a need for timely and appropriate treatment of patients with uncontrolled asthma. Improving asthma control could be achieved by a better identification of causes followed by remediating modifiable factors in primary care or referral to secondary care. However, major gaps in evidence-based asthma practice exist in primary care. So far, there is a lack of knowledge on the prevalence of inadequate asthma and associated characteristics.\n\nObjective: The primary objective is to determine the proportion of primary care patients with inadequate asthma control, as assessed during a regular control consultation with the general practice nurse.\n\nStudy design: This is a non-interventional prospective observational study, taking place in a real-world primary care setting.\n\nStudy population: Patients diagnosed with asthma, who attend a pre-planned primary care asthma review, are eligible to participate. A limited number of in- and exclusion criteria will be adopted, to make sure the research population closely resembles the real world.\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with inadequate asthma control. Inadequate asthma control will be defined as an exacerbation in the past 4 weeks and/or an ACQ6 (i.e., Asthma Control Questionnaire) score 30.75."

"DetailedDescription": "Striae distensae are atrophic dermal scars that can cause psychosocial distress on affected patients. Despite numerous available therapeutic modalities, no gold standard therapy has been established. Picosecond lasers are a newer advancement in lasers that have primarily used in the treatment of tattoos. A fractional 1064-nm picosecond laser has recently become available for the treatment of pigmentation and skin rejuvenation. The main mechanism of action is tissue ablation via laser induced optical breakdown (LIOB) which occur when pulse intensity is high enough to strip electrons and generating plasma, the plasma absorbs the remaining laser energy forming a cavitation bubble within the dermis which has been demonstrated to improve fine wrinkles and acne scar through the stimulation of collagen formation."

 "BriefSummary": "Patients presenting for colonoscopy at one of the participating centers will be asked to participate in the present study after careful evaluation of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Before inclusion, all patients have to sign the written informed consent. All participating patients will receive PLENVU, a well-known and approved bowel preparation agent. Patients are randomly assigned in two groups. Patients in group 1 are informed in traditional way on how to use the bowel preparation agent. This way includes discussion with the physician and nurse on how to use the bowel preparation agent and a written documentation, highlighting the individual steps again. Patients in group 2 will receive in addition a QR-code referring to an App, available for free in all App stores, explaining to the patient in detail when and how to use the bowel preparation agent. The patient is receiving the same questionnaire (please see attached) in both groups and asked to bring the filled form on the day of the examination. Endoscopy is performed in standard way and effectiveness of the bowel preparation is specifically highlighted by the physician on the documentation report. Finally, data is analyzed regarding effectiveness of the QR code regarding patient satisfaction, acceptability and quality of the bowel preparation.",
"DetailedDescription": "Patient education is of paramount importance for high acceptance and an adequate bowel preparation. Using the QR code directly referring to the App for bowel preparation with PLENVU might accelerate the discussion between the medical doctor and the patient and might also improve the acceptance rate of the patients for the bowel preparation finally leading to a more enhanced and effective bowel-preparation.\n\nPatients undergoing screening or surveillance endoscopy will be prospectively included and randomly assigned to one of the following groups: Group 1: App; Group 2: no-App Study end points addressed below are prospectively assessed and evaluated for any significant changes."

 "BriefSummary": "According to the WISDOM study, withdraw of inhaled steroids has no effect on the acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but the lung function of patients with COPD is significantly reclined. In the subgroup analysis of this study, patients with COPD were found to have continued to use inhaled steroids in patients with eosinophilic leukocytes greater than 400 cells/ul or whom has more than two episodes of exacerbation per year. However, in SUNSET study, it was pointed out that withdraw of inhaled steroids had no effect on lung function in patients with COPD, but it was also found that in patients with COPD, eosinophilic leukocytes in the blood were greater than 300 cells/ul, have a better therapeutic response in steroid inhalation. In addition, some studies have shown that in patients with COPD, a decline in lung function after discontinuation of inhaled steroids can make the patient's clinical symptoms worse and increase the risk of acute exacerbations. However, in other comprehensive analytical studies, there are different outcomes. There is no statistically significant difference in the risk of acute exacerbation in patients with COPD after discontinuation of inhaled steroids.\n\nIn past studies, it was noted that inhaled steroids cause an increased risk of pneumonia in patients with COPD. However, in these studies, the diagnosis of pneumonia was only from the clinician's suspicion without clear symptom assessment, laboratory examination, microbiological evidence or imaging assessment. Therefore, further research is needed to assess whether patients are suitable for the reduction of inhaled steroids and the impact of COPD in clinical treatment."

 "BriefSummary": "The aim of the research is to (1) evaluate the potential clinical effectiveness and biological mechanisms of indoor cycling in the treatment of obesity and (2) provide-up-to-date evidence on the impact of indoor cycling in reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, namely, hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, endothelial dysfunction. We hypothesize that IC training, can be a good stimulus to mitigate cardiovascular risk factors in women with obesity and to improve values of the examined indicators towards that occurring in women with normal body weight.\n\nThe study was designed as a prospective exercise intervention trial. The study involved women with obesity (OW) and women with normal body weight (NW). Both study groups underwent the same 3-month physical training program. Outside the implemented program, all participants were instructed to maintain their normal physical activity, diet and not to use any dietary supplements. Dietary intake was assessed using interviews conducted at baseline and after completion of the trial. The amount of nutrients in participant's daily diet was processed and evaluated using a dietetics computer program. The intake of nutrients, total caloric intake during the study were constant in both groups. Anthropometric parameters, blood pressure and physical capacity were measured and blood samples were taken at baseline and after completion of the physical training program.\n\nThe study involved 31 obese or normal weight women aged 34-62. A total of 23 women with obesity (body mass index (BMI) = 30 kg/m2; waist circumference > 80 cm) registered and screened from among 163 women at the outpatient clinic of the Department of Internal Medicine, Metabolic Disorders, and Hypertension, University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland were enrolled to OW group. The NW group consisted of 8 healthy women from the announcement (BMI = 24.9 and = 18.5 kg/m2).\n\nInformed consent was obtained from all participants, and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Poznan University of Medical Sciences (case no. 1077/12; supplement no. 753/13). The study conformed to all ethical issues included in the Helsinki Declaration.\n\nThe 3-month intervention consisted of a physical exercise program involving three indoor cycling sessions per week, with a total of 36 training sessions. Subjects exercised on cycle ergometers Schwinn® Evolution® (Schwinn Bicycle Company, Boulder, Colorado, USA). Each session lasted approximately 55 minutes. Training sessions consisted of a 5-min low-intensity warm-up (cycling at 50-65% of maximum heart rate (HRmax)), 40 min of main training at an intensity of 65-95% of HRmax, 5 min of non-weight-bearing cycling, finishing with 5 min of low-intensity cool-down stretching and breathing exercises.\n\nMain part of the training was interval. Each exercise session consisted of 3 to 4 high intensity intervals with intensity exceeding 80% of HRmax, often reaching anaerobic threshold. High intensity intervals lasted approximately 4-minutes and were interspersed by recovery periods at 65-80% of HRmax.\n\nHR during sessions was monitored with a Suunto Fitness Solution® device (Suunto, Vantaa, Finland). To ensure that assigned exercise intensities were obtained, the average per cent of the maximum heart rate during the entire training session was obtained from the device Blood samples for biochemical analyses were taken from a basilic vein, after overnight 12-hour fasting. In the serum samples, parameters were measured using commercially available enzyme-linked immunoassays.\n\nBoth before and after the whole training programme, the following measurements were made: body weight and height, BMI, waist and hip circumference, WHR, body composition (DXA), total-body skeletal muscle mass index, graded exercise test, isokinetic muscle strength of knee flexors and extensors, exercise and resting blood pressure, and the heart rate. Vascular endothelial function indices (eNOS, VEGF, TBARS and TAS) as well as TCH, LDL-C, HDL-C, TG, oxLDL and CRP of venous blood were determined.\n\nA sample size was determined according to changes in VO2 peak. A total of 6 subjects in OW group and 7 subjects in NW group was calculated to yield at least 80% power of detecting an intervention effect as statistically significant at the 0.05 a level.",
"DetailedDescription": "Anthropometric measurements were conducted with the subjects wearing light clothing and no shoes. Weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg and height to the nearest 0.5 cm. BMI was calculated as weight divided by height squared (kg/m2 ). Obesity was defined as BMI = 30 kg/m2. Waist circumference (cm) was measured at the level of the iliac crest at the end of normal expiration. Hip circumference was measured at the maximum protuberance of the buttocks. Waist and hip circumferences were measured to the nearest 0.5 cm. Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was calculated as waist circumference divided by hip circumference. Index of central obesity (ICO) was calculated as waist circumference (cm) divided by height (cm) (Parikh, et al., 2012).\n\nBody composition analysis was assessed using DXA (GE Healthcare Lunar Prodigy Advance; GE Medical Systems, Milan, Italy). The subjects were instructed not to make any intense physical effort in the 24h prior to the examination. The subjects were given complete instructions on the examination procedure. They wore cotton T-shirt, shorts, and socks and lay on the DXA table supine and motionlessly during the testing procedure. They were instructed to remove all metal, rubber, and plastic objects that might affect the X-ray beam. The same well-trained laboratory technician positioned the subjects, performed the scans, and executed the analysis according to the operator's manual, using the standard analysis protocol. Total body fat mass and lean body mass were determined using standard scan mode (in case of moderately obese subjects) or thick scan mode (in case of extremely obese subjects); the absorbed dose of radiation was 0.4 µGy and 0.8 µGy, respectively.\n\nTo determine the subjects' physical capacity, a Graded Exercise Test (GXT) was performed on an electronically braked cycle ergometer (Kettler ® DX1 Pro, Kettler, Ense, Germany). GXT began at a work rate of 25 W (60 rev/min). The work rate was incremented by 25 W every 2 min until the subject could no longer maintain the required pedal cadence. Each test lasted 4-14.5 min, depending on age and aerobic fitness status. The exercise tests were conducted between 8: 00 and 12: 00 a.m. in an air-conditioned laboratory, 2 h after consuming a light breakfast. Expired gases, minute ventilations (Ve), and heart rate (HR) during GXT were monitored continuously with an automated system (Oxycon Mobile ® ; Viasys Healthcare, Hoechberg, Germany). Oxygen intake (VO 2 ) and carbon dioxide output (VCO 2 ) was measured breath-by-breath and averaged over 15-second periods. Before each trial, the system was calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Peak VO2 was defined as the highest 15-second averaged VO 2 obtained during the final exercise load on the test. HR peak (bpm) was measured as the highest 15-second average value in the test. To determine ventilatory threshold (VT), the V-slope method was administered using computerized regression analysis on the slopes of the CO 2 output versus O2 uptake plot, which detects the beginning of the excess CO 2 output generated from the buffering of H +. The method involves analyzing the behavior of VCO 2 as a function of VO 2 during GXT with a consequent increase in VCO 2 . This results in a transition in the relationship between VCO 2 and VO 2 . The software supplied by Viasys Healthcare was used, supported with a visual inspection on the part of an experienced researcher. As a secondary method, the ventilatory equivalent method (VEQ method) was employed and the point at which the equivalent for oxygen (VE/VO 2 ) increased without a concomitant rise in the equivalent for carbon dioxide (VE/VCO 2 ) was detected. The VT was expressed as a heart rate (HR VT ).\n\nExercise blood pressure was measured during a GXT using a digital electronic tensiometer (model 705IT TM, Omron Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). The measurement was taken during maximal work rate. Exercise HR was measured as the highest 15-second average value in the GXT. Resting blood pressure was measured fasting in the morning hours, in a sitting position with the legs uncrossed and the back and arm supported. Resting HR was measured under the same conditions, using auscultation of the heart by stethoscope. Regular or large adult cuffs were used, depending on the patient's arm circumference."

 "BriefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate methods to modify blood pressure in humans and measure the effectiveness of such methods. A secondary outcome is to evaluate the performance of an investigational continuous non-invasive blood pressure (cNIBP) device created by Sensifree. The tests will per performed in non-hospitalized subjects under varied controlled conditions that include resting blood pressure and non-pharmacologically induced blood pressure changes.",
"DetailedDescription": "On a first visit a screening procedure to verify inclusion / exclusion criteria are met will be conducted. On the primary procedure visit, data collection will begin with the subjects having the investigational device, ECG sensors, and 1 or more pulse oximetry sensors placed on them for data collection and to monitor their safety for the duration of the study. A physician will place an arterial line in the radial artery. The Sensifree cNIBP system will be calibrated with an oscillometric and/or auscultatory blood pressure cuff measurement taken on the arm opposite the arterial line.\n\nA series of blood pressure changes will be induced, including various combinations of methods."

 "BriefSummary": "The purpose of the current study is to accelerate the use of a clinically available therapeutic already FDA-approved for other indications in the setting of pandemic COVID-19 addressing a serious and emergent unmet medical need.\n\nThis is a randomized, double-blind study of atovaquone therapy in adult participants hospitalized with COVID-19. Approximately 60 participants who meet all eligibility criteria may be randomized in a 2:1 atovaquone/placebo ratio into one of the following treatment groups:\n\nTreatment Group 1: continued standard of care therapy together with an oral dose of 1500 mg atovaquone twice daily (administered with a meal or snack) for up to 10 days\n\nTreatment Group 2: continued standard of care therapy together with matching placebo",
"DetailedDescription": "Design of the ATaQ COVID-19 Trial:\n\nThe purpose of the current study is to accelerate the use of a clinically available therapeutic already FDA-approved for other indications in the setting of pandemic COVID-19 addressing a serious and emergent unmet medical need. In consideration of the information included in this protocol, the overall risks to participants are outweighed by the potential benefits of atovaquone experimental therapy for the treatment of COVID-19. The benefit-risk balance for this study is considered positive.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\nDiagnosis of COVID-19 by positive RT-PCR requiring hospitalization within 72 hours\nAge =18 years old\nAble to provide informed consent, or (as allowed by IRB), immediate availability of designated legally authorized representative to provide consent by proxy\nAnticipated hospitalization for >48 hours\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\nPatients who meet any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in this study:\n\nParticipation in any other clinical trial with antiviral activity against COVID-19\nBreastfeeding women\nKnown hypersensitivity to atovaquone or formulation excipient\nActive treatment with rifampin\nHIV patients with AIDS requiring treatment for Pneumocystis jirovecii or Toxoplasma gondii\nNot expected to survive for 72 hours.\n\n>14 days from symptom onset\n\nRandomization:\n\nPatients who meet eligibility criteria and volunteer to participate will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to atovaquone or placebo on Day 1 using computerized randomization. An unblinded investigational pharmacist not otherwise involved in the trial will know treatment assignment and dispense investigational product. As GI absorption of atovaquone increased when taken with food, so we will administer with a meal or snack.\n\nBlinding:\n\nDouble blinding of treatment assignments will be performed in this study, with the study team and patients blinded to treatment assignment.\n\nThe list of concomitant medications will be assessed only from Day 1 prior to enrollment to Day 15 or discharge, whichever is earlier.\n\nPatient Enrollment and Treatment Assignment:\n\nEntry into screening does not guarantee enrollment into the study. In order to manage the total study enrollment, the study researchers may suspend screening and/or enrollment at any at any time.\n\nPretreatment Assessments:\n\nScreening Visit\n\nPatients will be screened within 2 days before randomization and dosing to determine eligibility for participation in the study. Screening will occur under approved HIPAA waiver for research to identify and screen all hospitalized COVID-19 positive patients on a daily basis.\n\nObtain informed consent.\n\nAfter informed consent has been negotiated and the form signed, the following assessments will be performed to determine eligibility requirements as specified in the inclusion and exclusion criteria:\n\nReview of focused medical history including the following information (e.g., date of first symptoms, overall symptoms, exposure source, demographics, baseline characteristics), allergies and past medical history.\nReview and record medications and therapies for the current illness\nRecording of vital signs (heart rate, temperature, blood pressure), body weight, and height\nDocumentation of respiratory support: Respiratory Rate, Oxygen supplementation: room air, nasal canula, face mask, non-rebreather, high-flow device, mechanical ventilation; and FiO2\nSpO2 at rest or PaO2\nRadiographic findings\n\nStudy patients who qualify and volunteer to participate should be immediately consented and randomized. Randomization and initiation of dosing should occur on the same day if possible.\n\nBaseline/Day 1 Assessments\n\nThe following evaluations are to be completed at the Day 1 visit. The investigator must have confirmed eligibility and signing of consent before proceeding with randomization on the Day 1 visit, followed immediately by first dose of investigational product. The assessments can be completed by the patient care team and do not need to be repeated by research personnel. The following assessments must be documented before administering investigational product, using the most recent data available at the time of randomization:\n\nRecording of vital signs (heart rate, temperature, blood pressure, body weight, height)\n\nDocumentation of respiratory status:\n\nRespiratory rate\n\nOxygen supplementation and FiO2: room air, nasal canula, face mask, non-rebreather, noninvasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices, mechanical ventilation, or ECMO\n\nOxygenation: (SpO2 or PaO2)\n\nRadiographic findings (if available)\n\nReview AEs and document concomitant medications\n\nDocument Ordinal Scale at baseline\n\nObtain saliva sample and nasopharyngeal swab sample for viral load quantification at day 1 prior to initial dose\n\nObtain blood for research sample\n\nDaily Study Assessments (Days 2-15):\n\nThe following evaluations are to be documented daily from Days 2 - 15 or until discharge whichever comes earlier, using the data recorded at or closest to 12:00 noon each day:\n\nVital signs (heart rate, temperature, blood pressure), body weight (if available).\nDocumentation of respiratory status: Respiratory rate, Oxygen supplementation and FiO2: room air, nasal canula, face mask, non-rebreather, noninvasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices, mechanical ventilation, or ECMO\nOxygenation: (SpO2 or PaO2)\nRadiographic findings (if available)\nReview of AEs and document concomitant medications\nSaliva sample for COVID-19 RT-PCR every 12 hours (Days 2-8)\nSaliva sample for COVID-19 RT-PCR once daily (Days 9-15)\nAdditional blood draws for biobanking (Day 3, and 5 only)\n\nClinical Laboratory Assessments:\n\nClinical laboratory assessments will be conducted as clinically indicated and all laboratory testing will be completed by local laboratories. Clinical laboratory data to be captured in the trial database will include serum chemistries, liver function tests, complete blood counts including absolute neutrophil count, hs-CRP, D-dimer, ferritin, IL-6, troponin, NTpBNP.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 testing will include RT-qPCR to detect or quantify SARS-CoV-2 or virus sequencing results from saliva (baseline and daily until discharge or death, and 8 days and last day of hospitalization or Day 15 if still hospitalized.\n\nPretreatment and posttreatment samples with detectable SARS-CoV-2 may be sequenced for resistance monitoring of the viral polymerase gene. For all clinical laboratory tests, except those at Day 1, when more than 1 result is available in a calendar day, the value closest to 12:00 noon should be captured in the eCRF. For Day 1 tests, the most recent result before dosing should be used.\n\nPhysical Examination:\n\nNo physical examination is mandated by the study protocol beyond the capture of vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, blood pressure, SpO2 at rest or PaO2) as documented clinically.\n\nPost-treatment Assessments:\n\nTreatment will continue to complete a 10 Day course or until viral clearance is documented, whichever occurs first.\n\nTelephone call on Day 15 and 29 for those discharged. The phone call will include a brief survey on symptoms and information on any re-hospitalizations.\n\nFinal review of AEs and concomitant medication.\n\nVital signs will be captured if still inpatient and the ordinal scale will be assessed."

"DetailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the prevalence of genetic mutations in cancer patients seeking care at the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center at St. Vincent's Riverside in Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Perform a chart review to assess the impact of genetic testing as part of standard of oncology care:\n\nIa. Determine differences in germline mutation detection in these patients as compared to traditional guideline (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN]) based approach for genetic evaluation.\n\nIb. Determine the percentage of relatives of mutation positive probands undergoing family variant testing within a 3 month window of return of testing results.\n\nIc. Assess patient experience and barriers to care with a genetic service line via survey measures.\n\nId. Develop a biorepository of samples (blood) from cancer patients participating in this protocol.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients watch a pre-recorded genetic counseling video and those who consent to genetic testing undergo collection of blood samples. Patients also complete surveys over 5-15 minutes each prior to receiving their genetic test results and following the receipt of genetic test results."

 "BriefSummary": "Scarring from burn wounds remains a chronic and often severe sequela of burn injury. Burn wounds may be left to heal by secondary intention or treated with surgical skin grafting; in both circumstances, significant scars likely result. When surgical skin grafting is employed, skin graft harvest sites (\"donor sites\") likewise result in clinically significant scars.\n\nThis study will have interventional and observational components. Patients will receive the standard fractional ablative CO2 treatments to their scars resulting from burn wounds allowed to heal by secondary intention and/or those treated with skin grafts. These will be prospectively observed for the duration of the study as well as adjacent normal skin. In addition, a donor site that meets inclusion criteria that would not have otherwise received LSR will be identified as a treatment site. Patients with have one half of their donor sites randomized to standard of care (SOC) treatment, which consists of wound dressings, compression therapy, physical and occupational therapies and the other half randomized to SOC + ablative fractional CO2 laser therapy (LSR)."

The debonding of the brackets was observed for 18 months after the initial bondup. At the time of debonding it was also noted again whether the debonded bracket especially in case of lower teeth was in a premature bite with the upper teeth, if so the debonded bracket was not considered for the study. A debonding of the replacement bracket after the debonding of the initial bracket was not considered in our study. There were no changes in the study design after the commencement of the study.",

 "BriefSummary": "The intent of this study was to examine the recovery of individuals who had been hospitalized for COVID-19 in the year following their discharge from the hospital. Parameters studied included serum levels of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV 2) IgG antibody, tests of lung function, and imaging data to evaluate changes in lung fibrosis. Inaddition, we explored the systematic Immune&Inflammation in some of the individuals recovering from COVID-19.",
"DetailedDescription": "About 20% of COVID-19 developed into a critical illness and about 2% died. The global epidemic continues to develop, but some patients in China have entered the rehabilitation period, which is accompanied by a large number of respiratory symptoms and pulmonary fibrosis, bringing serious harm to the country.Therefore, early accurate detection and prediction of the development trend of patients in rehabilitation period and targeted treatment measures for corresponding patients are the key to the success of COVID-19 rehabilitation period. It will play a key role in the stratified management of the post-epidemic situation, which is crucial to improve the quality of life of COVID-19 patients. We explore the clinical characteristics of rehabilitation patients by detecting some indicators of patients in rehabilitation period, icluding serum SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV 2) IgG antibody, lung function, lung CT imaging, systematic Immune&Inflammation states."

 "BriefSummary": "Approximately 15% of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection / COVID-19 develop a severe clinical course. This leads to hospitalization and potentially life threatening complications such as pneumonia and respiratory failure. Predictors for early detection and risk stratification are urgently needed. Moreover, only scarce information is available for long-term follow-up and late complications associated with infection. We therefore aimed to find predictors for severe courses of the novel disease as well as to establish strategies for therapeutic monitoring and follow-up."

 "BriefSummary": "Subjects will be recently discharged patients from Sunnybrook Inpatient Psychiatry Unit. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the Caring Contact intervention or usual care. 75 subjects will be enrolled in each arm. In additional to usual discharge-related care, subjects in the caring contact group will receive brief emails that convey a message of hope and provide resources. These emails will be sent on days 4, 21, and 56 post-discharge. The specific content of these emails will be pre-determined varying slightly by time point. In contrast, the control group will only receive usual discharge-related care, including discharge planning and also a sheet of resources normally provided to patients. A widely used and validated measure will be employed to assess depression and anxiety symptoms. The 25-item self-report Hopkins Symptom Checklist will be emailed to all subjects at baseline, day 4, 21, and 56 post-discharge, along with the Caring Contact communication. It is hypothesized that there will be a significantly greater reduction in mental health symptoms among patients receiving Caring Contacts compared to those who receive usual care."

 "BriefSummary": "The purpose of the study is to apply a prospective observational design to describe the emerging functional impairments of subjects affected by COVID-19 in the acute phase and monitor their course and impact on activities and participation up to 12 months of onset. The ultimate goal is to provide a reliable framework to plan rehabilitation delivery to COVID-19 survivors in each phase and foresee health needs in the medium and long term. The secondary objective of the study is to find predictors of functional recovery, among pre-existing and emerging individual and contextual factors, with a special focus on the latency of rehabilitation start after hospital admission.",
"DetailedDescription": "The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, COronaVIrus Disease-19 (COVID-19), was first reported on December 31, 2019. About 20% patients, mostly elderly people, suffered from a severe form of acute respiratory failure. COVID-19 is a new clinical entity, therefore its understanding is largely incomplete, in particular as regards medium and long term consequences both in the clinical and functional domain. An early integration of rehabilitation care since the acute phase is often required to cope with the functional sequelae of the severe respiratory syndromes, as well of cardiac and neurological complications. However, indications, approaches, timing, amount and settings are mainly unknown due to the lack of epidemiological data regarding the impact of COVID-19 in terms of body function impairment and activity limitations in the short term and participation restrictions in the medium and long-term.\n\nThe purpose of the study is to apply a prospective observational design to describe the emerging functional impairments of subjects affected by COVID-19 in the acute phase and monitor their course and impact on activities and participation up to 12 months of onset. The ultimate goal is to provide a reliable framework to plan rehabilitation delivery to COVID-19 survivors in each phase and foresee health needs in the medium and long term. The secondary objective of the study is to find predictors of functional recovery, among pre-existing and emerging individual and contextual factors, with a special focus on the latency of rehabilitation start after hospital admission.\n\nThe study protocol complements measures of functioning with the indicators used in the registration form for clinical characterization cases disseminated by the World Health Organization: in doing so, the authors aim to support the global project of providing Member States with a standardized approach to collect clinical data.\n\nStudy objectives Primary Objective: To describe the emerging functional impairments in patients hospitalized for SARS-COV-2 infection (COVID-19), and monitor their course and impact on activities and participation up to 12 months of onset Secondary Objective: To search for predictive factors of recovery, among the pre-existing and emerging individual and context-related ones. Particular attention will be paid to the presence and latency of rehabilitation delivery after hospital admission, describing the functional evolution of subjects who received rehabilitation since the acute phase, compared to those who did not.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS. Study Design. Prospective observational study with 12-month follow-up. Total study duration: 18 months Population. Adults, male and female, admitted to the University Hospital \"Ospedali Riuniti of Ancona\" (UH-ORA) from March 1st, 2020 for the management of acute COVID-19 infection, able to provide written or oral informed consent. The only exclusion criterion will be the lack of information concerning clinical data regarding the management in the acute ward.\n\nData collection: A paper CRF and an eCRF will be implemented to record patients' data\n\nClinical, laboratory and instrumental data collected in the acute phase will be retrieved, retrospectively, from patients' clinical records.\nData concerning function impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions will be collected through direct assessment carried out by the rehabilitation team at the enrollment, on the first referral of the patient for counseling (T0) and at hospital discharge (Td) (for those who will receive rehabilitation in the acute ward), as well as at 3 , 6 and 12 months of COVID-19 diagnosis (T3, T6, T12). Patient reported outcomes will be assessed through questionnaires and interviews, also delivered by telephone or video-consultation.\n\nThe primary endpoint is the change in the overall health status observed at enrolment (T0), compared to the pre-COVID-19 condition, and its evolution at 3, 6 and 12 months. To this aim, we will assess:\n\nindependence in activities of daily living (ADLs), by the modified Rankin scale. The modified Rankin scale is a rapid and validated measure of global independence in ADL with a score ranging from 0 (no disability) to 5 (bedridden). To assess changes, the pre-COVID mod. Rankin scale score, retrospectively ascertained, will be compared to the scores prospectively collected at enrolment and at 3, 6 and 12 months\nwalking performance, by the Walking Handicap scale (WHS). The Walking Handicap scale is a quick and validated measure of walking performance, with a score ranging from 1 (Physiological walker: Walks for exercise only either at home or in parallel bars during physical therapy) to 6 (Community walker: Independent in all home and community activities. Can accept crowds and uneven terrain. Demonstrates complete independence in shopping centers). To assess changes, the pre-COVID WHS score, retrospectively ascertained, will be compared to the scores prospectively collected at 3, 6 and 12 months\nhealth-related quality of life perception, by the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36). SF-36 is a widespread validated scale assessing patient-reported changes in health-related well-being perception over the last 4 weeks. SF-36 scores will be collected at 3, 6 and 12 months.\n\nThe secondary endpoint is the identification of the predictors of functional recovery at 3, 6 and 12 months, among the pre-existing and emerging individual and context-related factors.\n\nThe following explanatory variables will be considered:\n\nPre-existing individual factors: age, gender, blood type, nutritional status, comorbidity (Modified Cumulative Illness Rating Scale - CIRS), life habits and pre-existing disability (modified Rankin Scale and Walking Handicap scale in pre-COVID phase)\nEmerging individual factors: severity of COVID-19 on admission to the acute ward, severity of pneumonia during hospitalization (according to Li et al 2020), blood chemistry (e.g. levels of interleukine, albumin, creatinine, CRP), pulmonary thromboembolism, neurologic complications, swallow disorders in the acute phase; severity of body function impairment and activity limitation on enrolment (as measured by the Trunk control test-TCT, Standing Balance-SB, Functional Ambulation Category-FAC, modified Barthel index- mBI, Montreal Cognitive Assessment-MoCA)\nEmerging context-related factors: drug treatment in the acute phase (e.g. ACE inhibitors, Angiotensin II receptor blockers, Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, Antivirals, heparin), procedures adopted in the ICU (prone positioning, tracheostomy, support for ventilation, ECMO, Renal replacement therapy or dialysis, Inotropes/vasopressors), rehabilitation delivery in the acute ward and latency from hospital admission to rehabilitation start.\n\nClinical-functional evaluations will be carried out at the following time-points:\n\nT0 = on enrolment Td = discharge from the acute ward (only for subjects who are enrolled during their stay in the acute ward) T3, T6, T12 = three, six and 12 months after hospital admission due to COVID-19 infection.\n\nAfter discharge from hospital, the assessments will be carried out in the outpatient laboratory; in case of mobility restrictions, questionnaires will be delivered and interviews will be conducted by telephone or by video consulting.\n\nSample size and data analysis. Given the nature of the study, a formal calculation of the sample size was not made. The enrolment of at least 100 subjects is estimated based on COVID-19 incidence in the catchment population of the UH-ORA.\n\nA descriptive analysis will be conducted on the collected variables using point estimates and variability measures for quantitative variables or absolute and relative frequencies for category variables.\n\nA multivariate model will be constructed to extrapolate predictors of poor recovery at 12 months (i.e. Delta T12-T0 on modified Rankin score : >1), by adjusting for potential confounders. After checking for the normal distribution of quantitative measures, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures will be applied to analyze the distribution of functional outcome measures, at 3, 6 and 12 months, among those who received rehabilitation in the acute phase, respect to those who did not."

 "BriefSummary": "This will be a prospective, open label, randomized multi-center study using a novel Percutaneous Osseointegrated Prosthesis (POP) device for direct skeletal prosthetic limb attachment in persons with transfemoral level lower limb amputations. Subjects will be recruited within the United States who have experienced lower limb loss at the transfemoral level, at least 24 months prior to consent.",
"DetailedDescription": "Primary Objectives: The first co-primary objective is to compare the 12-month success rate based on the QTFA Problem Score in participants randomized to a control optimized socket (SOCKOPT) arm to participants randomized to the POP intervention at 12 months.\n\nSecond co-primary objective: Evaluate the Safety and efficacy at 24 months of the POP device as compared to an a priori determined performance goal. This co-primary outcome is a composite measure with four components: 1) Q-TFA problem score, 2) survival of the device (survivorship), 3) radiographic success criteria, and 4) absence of device-related serious adverse events. A successful POP subject (or successful device) at 24 months must achieve success on all four domains. Domain components and their success criteria are outlined below:\n\nCOMPONENT SUCCESS CRITERIA\n\nQ-TFA problem score* Decrease of 16 or more from baseline or a 24-month score 8 (*)\n\n* the MCID is 16. The score of 8 = MCID/2.\n\nSurvivorshipAbsence of implant removal\nRadiographic<5 mm of distal bone resorption AND <2 mm of radiolucency in the porous coated region of the implant\nSerious Adverse EventsAbsence of device or procedure-related serious adverse events including osteomyelitis, implant loosening, periprosthetic fracture, implant breakage\n\nStudy Hypotheses: The first co-primary hypothesis will compare the rate of subjects with a decrease of 16 or more in Q-TFA problem score from baseline to 12 months or a 12-month Q-TFA problem score 8 in the POP arm with the corresponding rate in the SOCKOPT arm.\n\nNull Hypothesis: The proportion of subjects with a decrease of 16 or more in Q-TFA problem score from baseline to 12 months or a 12-month Q-TFA problem score 8 in the POP arm is lower than the corresponding rate in the SOCKOPT arm.\n\nH_01: _POP^\"P1\" - _SOCKOPT^\"P1\" <0 Alternative Hypothesis: The proportion of subjects with a decrease of 16 or more in Q-TFA problem score from baseline to 12 months or a 12-month Q-TFA problem score 8 in the POP arm is higher than the corresponding rate in the SOCKOPT arm.\n\nH_A1: _POP^\"P1\" - _SOCKOPT^\"P1\" 0 where _SOCKOPT^\"P1\" \"and\" _POP^\"P1\" are the rates subjects with a decrease of 16 or more in Q-TFA problem score from baseline to 12 months or a 12-month Q-TFA problem score 8.\n\nThe second co-primary hypothesis will compare the rate of events of the second co-primary objective in POP implanted subjects with a pre-specified performance goal (PG). In testing the second co-primary hypothesis, the data collected on all POP implanted subjects will be included.\n\nNull Hypothesis: The true rate of subjects with the POP implant who satisfy the criteria i.-iv., is lower than 55% H_02: _POP< 55% Alternative Hypothesis: The true rate of subjects with the POP implant who satisfy the criteria i.-iv., is higher than 55% H_A2: _POP 55%\n\nwhere _POP denotes the true rate of subjects with the POP implant who satisfy the criteria i.-iv.\n\nOverall Hypotheses: In assessing the effectiveness, the overall null hypothesis (H_0) is that least one of the null hypotheses H_01 or H_02 are true and the overall alternative hypothesis (H_A) is that both H_A1 and H_A2 are true, or H_0: H_01 or H_02 H_A: H_A1 and H_A2 The ITT analysis set will be used as a primary analysis set. A sensitivity analysis will be carried out using the Per Protocol (PP) analysis set.\n\nSecondary Objectives: The data used in assessing the secondary objectives will be collected for all study subjects as detailed in Tables 2 and 3. These outcomes involve the change over time using a broad range of functional and psychological domains.\n\nEvaluate efficacy of the device to improve the ease of prosthetic limb attachment, reduce pain interference, and improve quality of life compared to preoperative baseline.\n\nEvaluate the efficacy of the device to improve functional mobility and community-based ambulation activity levels compared to preoperative baseline.\n\nEvaluate the efficacy of the device to improve psychosocial adjustment and reduce self-reported activity restrictions compared to preoperative baseline.\n\nEvaluate subject reported satisfaction with the device compared to preoperative baseline.\n\nExploratory Objectives: The data for assessing the exploratory objectives will be collected annually for all study subjects and involve the change over time from preoperative baseline.\n\nEvaluate bone response to the POP device as measured by DEXA scanning Evaluate efficacy of the device to normalize kinematic and kinetic parameters of gait during prosthetic ambulation compared to preoperative baseline.\n\nEvaluate efficacy of the device to enhance the metabolic efficiency of prosthetic ambulation compared to preoperative baseline.\n\nStudy assessments will be collected at the following time points: Prior to randomization (baseline), and 8, 24, 52 and 104 weeks after Stage 2 surgery in the POP intervention cohort. The second co-primary composite outcome assessment will be at 104 weeks following Stage 2 surgery. The cohort randomized to the SOCKOPT intervention will be assessed at baseline prior to randomization and at 8, 24, and 52 weeks following the initial SOCKOPT intervention session.\n\nSelf-reported Prosthetic Problems, Prosthetic Device Use, Global Performance, and Prosthetic Mobility (Questionnaire for Persons with a Transfemoral Amputation Subscales) Time and effort to Don/Doff prosthesis (Time and Effort function measure) Functional mobility, agility and walking endurance [6 Minute Walk Test (6-MWT) and Edgren Side Step Test (ESS)] Community-based prosthetic ambulation (Stepwatch Activity Monitor) Pain interference (PROMIS Pain Interference Scale) Psychosocial adjustment, mood and activity restriction [Trinity Amputation and Prosthesis Experience Scales-Revised (TAPES) and Patient Health Questioinaire-9 (PHQ9)] Self-reported overall life satisfaction and quality of life (Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire Well-Being subsection - PEQWB) Self-reported satisfaction with prosthesis (TAPES) Absence of radiolucency, overt loosening and implant fracture (Radiographic Grading) Absence of bone resorption around the implant (Radiographic Grading of predefined periprosthetic zones)\n\nExploratory Assessments:\n\nBone response to POP device (DEXA scanning) Instrumented Gait Lab Analysis, Gait Summary Measure Instrumented Treadmill and Gas Exchange Analysis"

 "BriefSummary": "This phase II trial studies how well lopinavir/ritonavir works in treating COVID-19 positive patients with cancer and a weakened immune system (immune-suppression) in the last year and have mild or moderate symptoms caused by COVID-19. Lopinavir/ritonavir may help to lessen or prevent COVID-19 symptoms from getting worse in cancer patients.",
"DetailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine if treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir will decrease progression of symptoms compared to control/placebo.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine if treatment improves time to symptom resolution. II. Determine the time to symptom progression. III. Determine time to improvement of participants as defined by complete resolution of symptoms.\n\nIV. Determine the proportion of participants who have severe or critical symptoms and hospital admission.\n\nV. Determine the time to hospital admission for those who develop severe of critical symptoms VI. Determine the proportion of participants with an intensive care unit (ICU) admission.\n\nVII. Determine the proportion of participants receiving ventilator support. VIII. Determine survival of participants enrolled on the study.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. For patients admitted to the hospital, will determine the following parameters: potassium level, blood oxygen level, creatinine, and blood pressure.\n\nII. Identify obstacles and barriers encountered while implementing a clinical trial in the context of a pandemic caused by a contagious disease and associated social distancing.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nGROUP I: Patients receive lopinavir/ritonavir orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nGROUP II: Patients receive placebo PO BID for 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up 3 times a week until symptoms resolve plus 2 additional weeks thereafter, for up to 3 months, whichever occurs first."

 "BriefSummary": "Following colorectal surgery, many patients face a combination of physical and emotional problems for a long period of time. Symptoms such as pain, fatigue, and disturbed bowel and sexual function, as well as problems in social and role functioning, inevitably affect the patients' well-being. Therefore, evaluation of the self-reported quality of life (QoL) is becoming increasingly important in clinical trials. The investigators aimed to compare long term health related life quality (HRQoL) results of laparoscopic approach with open approach in patients with sphincter preserving resections for rectal cancer at a single-center.",
"DetailedDescription": "This study is planned prospectively. All patients scheduled for operation due to rectal cancer in our clinic between January 2017 and December 2018 will be evaluated for suitability for the study. During the preoperative examination, patients will be informed about the study and their written consent will be obtained. Patients will be randomized between open and laparoscopic groups in the ratio 2:1, depending on the type of surgery. Clinical data of patients will be analyzed from the hospital database programme.\n\nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CR29 questionnaires prepared by The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) will be used to evaluate the quality of life after the operation. The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire will be completed by examining the patients' daily observation notes. EORTC QLQ-CR29 will be completed with face to face interviews in the first year after surgery.\n\nIn this way, it will be aimed to compare the early and long-term quality of life (HRQoL) results of open and laparoscopic approach in patients undergoing surgery for rectal cancer."

 "BriefSummary": "All international guidelines recommend 6-monthly ultrasound surveillance for patients at risk for liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma or HCC), such as patients with cirrhosis. The aim of surveillance is to detect HCC at an early stage when it is still potentially curable. Currently only 4 out of 10 HCCs are detected at the early stage.\n\nUltrasound surveillance for HCC has a wide ranging sensitivity, dependent on many factors such as operator experience, patient body habitus and liver parenchymal heterogeneity due to chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. In a select group of patients, surveillance ultrasound can be suboptimal or near non-diagnostic.\n\nCurrently no guideline offers an alternative surveillance tool for patients who have suboptimal surveillance ultrasounds.",

 "BriefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to assess the benefits of a 8-week yoga program on quality of life in patients suffering from chronic chikungunya.\n\nStudies have already shown the effectiveness of yoga practice on various arthralgia's, on the reduction of inflammatory reactions, on psychological disorders/sleep disorders and on quality of life. Considering quality of life as a global experience of balance between physical and mental wellbeing, the hypothesis was that the practice of yoga would globally improve the quality of life of patients with chronic chikungunya.",
"DetailedDescription": "The chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arbovirus passed to humans by Aedes mosquitoes. Since its description in 1952, CHIKV has caused millions of human infections in Africa, the Indian Ocean islands, Asia, Europe and America (1). In total, since 2013, the epidemic has affected more than 2 million people in the Americas. In Guadeloupe, the emergence of chikungunya cases began in 2013. CHINKV was declared an epidemic in 2014 with an estimated 20,000 infected patients.Human infection with CHIKV is characterized by a sudden onset of severe joint pains, high fever and rash. The infection is self-limited and acute symptoms usually disappear within one or two weeks. However, this polyarthralgia is recurrent in 30 to 40% of infected people and can persist for years. Chikungunya is considered chronic if the symptoms persist after three months. The chronic stage can last from a few months to several years. Chronic chikungunya usually manifests as joint pain and stiffness, polyarthralgia (including rheumatoid arthritis, flare-ups of spondylitis), and other general symptoms such as intermittent headaches, edema, and paresthesia. The consequences of chronic CHIKV can be severe, with patients becoming maladjusted to their lifestyle, feeling weakened and diminished. Depression and medical leaves are very frequent, with many cases of disability. Yoga is an ancestral Indian practice aiming to connect the \"body\" and the \"soul\", the \"self\" and \"the other\". Traditionally, it is a philosophical way of living, sometimes combined with the practice of physical exercises. In westernized countries, Yoga is usually considered as a physical practice or an alternative therapy, using various techniques of breathing, relaxation and poses to release tensions and decrease pain.\n\nStudies have already shown the effectiveness of yoga practice on various arthralgia's, on the reduction of inflammatory reactions, on psychological disorders/sleep disorders and on quality of life. Considering quality of life as a global experience of balance between physical and mental wellbeing, the hypothesis was that the practice of yoga, by improving these different aspects, would globally improve the quality of life of patients with chronic chikungunya."

Each participant is asked to choose the hospital that they would consider to be \"higher-performing\" between two hospitals: one hospital with a non-selective, \"accepting\" strategy (takes all donor heart offers), and one hospital with a more selective, \"cherrypicking\" strategy (tends to reject donor offers that are less than \"excellent\" quality).",

 "BriefSummary": "Our aim was to investigate and compare placental elasticity by using Shear wave elastography (SWE) in patients with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) with and without insulin to non-diabetic controls.\n\nThis prospective study included 319 pregnant patients. Three groups were created as follows: Group 1 (n= 79, GDM with insulin therapy), Group 2 (n=90, GDM with only diet) and Group 3 (n= 150, healthy controls) All patients were above 36 gestational weeks with anterior placenta. Totally six measurements including the central and peripheral parts (right, left) of the placenta both from maternal and fetal sites were obtained with SWE. Demographic, obstetrics, fetal and perinatal features were also compared. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was plotted and cut-off of elastographic velocity values were noted",
"DetailedDescription": "This prospective study included singleton pregnant women aged between 18-45 years who applied for third trimester prenatal examination (36 gestational weeks and above) between May 2019 and December 2019 at Women and Children Disease Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey. Ethical documents including Declaration of Helsinki were approved by local institutional review board (Approval number:49/2019) and a written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The study participants were divided into three groups according to treatments. While Group 1 consisted of patients with GDM using insulin therapy (GDM A2), patients with GDM treated with only diet (without any medical therapy) created Group 2 (GDM A1). Group 3 included healthy controls. Insulin therapy was initiated when target cut-off values were exceeded according to Carpenter and Coustan criteria. Patients with anterior placenta were included in the study because the effectiveness of the method decreased. Gestational age was recorded regarding last menstrual period and was checked in all participants by using a first trimester ultrasound report. All GDM patients were followed up in perinatology clinic and timing of delivery was organized individually basically on obstetrical indications. Ultrasonographic evaluation and SWE method were performed by single perinatologist Elastographic examinations were performed by physicians using Samsung HS70A ultrasound system with a Samsung CA1-7A convex transducer and S-Shear wave technique. During the examination, patients were lying in supine position, breathing levels kept steady to prevent noise and artifacts and minimum pressure were applied on the transducer to eliminate misleading tissue compression. A region of interest (ROI) box of 10 × 10 mm was positioned on placenta and six measurements were obtained from central and peripheral zones of placenta while avoiding vascular structures. Considering the disc-like structure of the placenta measurement areas were divided into six regions as follows: maternal right, maternal central, maternal left, fetal right, fetal central and fetal left. All measurements taken from different zones were recorded individually along with the mean value generated using IQR method. Through this approach, datasets were established not just for the auto-calculated mean value but also zone specific values for further analysis. All measurements were obtained in both kilopascal (kPa) and m/s formats."

 "BriefSummary": "The Sunnybrook Type 2 Diabetes Study (S2DS) is a prospective observational study of people with prediabetes or Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), that aims to understand the aetiologies, manifestations, and clinical consequences of mood and cognitive complications. The study recruits from the services at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and from the neighbouring University Health Network Toronto Rehabilitation Institute Cardiac Rehabilitation Program.",
"DetailedDescription": "The S2DS is a prospective observational study of people with prediabetes or T2DM recruited from Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and the neighbouring University Health Network Toronto Rehabilitation Institute Cardiac Rehabilitation Program. Participants recruited from Sunnybrook are receiving care from services there (e.g. Family Medicine, Endocrinology, and the Sunnybrook Diabetes Education Centre). Participants recruited from the Toronto Rehab are undertaking a 6-month stepped hybrid (home and clinic based) aerobic plus resistance exercise intervention as part of a program at that site (e.g. the Diabetes, Exercise, and Healthy Lifestyle Program).\n\nStudy assessments are conducted at baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 18 months. Main outcomes include cognitive performance, assessed using a detailed neurocognitive battery, and mood symptoms assessed via research criteria for a depressive episode and self-report instruments. Other lifestyle factors are also examined, including physical activity, sleep quality, diet, and subjective stress. Diabetes complications and characteristics are monitored, as are all concomitant medications and supplements. With permission, participant data are linked prospectively to public health records to ascertain long-term outcomes and health services utilization.\n\nThe cohort is characterized using biological, neuroimaging and biometric measures. Fasting morning blood and urine samples are taken at each assessment. Serum, plasma, whole blood, and white blood cells are bio-banked for biochemical, genetic and other analyses. The MRI study includes a 1.5 hr MRI scan at 3.0 T. Sequences performed include structural imaging (T1, T2, DTI and FLAIR) and resting state functional MRI. Two optional sub-studies are offered: a cerebrovascular reactivity MRI protocol, and a sleep quality and apnea protocol (baseline, 6 month and 18 month visits). The sleep study uses an overnight wearable sleep monitor."

 "BriefSummary": "The primary objective of this study is to study in heart failure (HF) patients to better assess HF disease state, which can aid in management and improve outcomes. Primary aims of the study include: (1) Measure HR and RR at rest and during daily activity using the WHOOP device. (2) Correlate HR and RR response to activity to New York Heart Association (NYHA) class and 90-day HF hospitalization rate. (3) Identify additional predictors of NYHA class and HF hospitalization rate for algorithm development to use the WHOOP device as a clinical tool for HF management.",
"DetailedDescription": "Heart Failure (HF) is a challenging condition to manage, with hospital readmission for HF exacerbation having negative impacts on patient outcomes and financial burden to both patient and health system [Lloyd-Jones, 2010; Yancy, 2017; Ross, 2009; Chaudhry, 2007]. An intuitive need for more sensitive predictors of HF exacerbations has led researchers to explore remote monitoring as a possible answer. Consumer-owned sensors have become more accurate in their recording of vital signs, and thus could hold potential for remote monitoring [Dickinson, 2018]. The combined measure of heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) has been shown to predict New York Heart Association (NYHA) HF class, an indicator of severity of heart disease, in implantable cardiac devices with multi-sensor monitoring capabilities [Auricchio, 2014; Prasun, 2019; Boehmer, 2015; Boehmer, 2017]. Heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of sympathetic autonomic function, has also shown potential in prediction of adverse cardiac events [Al-Zaiti, 2019; Shaffer, 2017; Bullinga, 2005; Tsuji, 1996].\n\nThe WHOOP device, a wearable strap similar to a Fitbit, allows for real-time HR monitoring and can determine RR using respiratory sinus arrhythmia [www.whoop.com/experience; Berryhill, 2020]. It is one of the few devices on the market that can accurately track heart rate as well as respiratory rate in real-time (during activity) and is equipped with a multidirectional accelerometer for activity tracking. The WHOOP device was recently externally validated against polysomnography and continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) for sleep tracking, and continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) for HR and HRV (with less than 5% error) [Berryhill, 2020]. HRV, which represents the balance of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, is a known predictor of cardiac events. It is especially useful in HF, which is a chronically elevated catecholamine state leading to depressed HRV and is tied to NYHA HF class, an indicator of severity of disease [Bullinga, 2005; Tsuji, 1996].\n\nData so far regarding the efficacy of remote physiologic monitoring using cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs), although promising in theory, has not yet proved sensitive in the detection of HF exacerbation. The aim of the CLEPSYDRA study was to use data extracted from implanted cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillation (CRT-D) devices in HF patients to predict heart failure events; although the main variables used in the novel algorithm, minute ventilation and patient activity, would intuitively seem to be predictors of poor outcome/HF exacerbation, the sensitivity of the algorithm to predict an event was only 34% [6]. It would appear that this combination of variables is not sufficient to predict adverse HF events. However, the HOME-CARE (HOME Monitoring in CArdiac REsynchronization Therapy) study showed more promising results, as their enhanced predictor, utilizing seven diagnostic variables from implanted CRT-Ds, boasted a sensitivity of 65.4% [Sack, 2011]. While the data from these studies is helpful, no study has been able to adequately identify and assess accurate predictors of HF class.\n\nCurrent efficacious management strategies are limited to hemodynamic or multisensor monitoring systems. However, these are only available in implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator (CRT-D) devices. These are not implanted in every HF patient [Al-Zaiti, 2019]. Non-invasive monitoring that provides similar data, such as wearable device monitoring, would expand the cohort of patients that would benefit from remote monitoring and would avoid the risks of having implanted hardware. Furthermore, better prediction of HF severity could help guide follow-up care and predict HF events [Boehmer, 2015; Boehmer 2017]. This would lead to more efficient management, less hospital readmission, and improve outcomes for HF patients overall [Dickinson, 2018].\n\nThe investigators propose a feasibility study in HF patients to better assess HF disease state, which can aid in management and improve outcomes. Subjects will wear the WHOOP device, which measures both activity and HR parameters and can derive RR using respiratory sinus arrhythmia, for 90 days. During this period, their HR and RR will be recorded at rest, during activity and post-activity recovery phases. This combined measure of HR/RR has been shown to predict NYHA HF class, an indicator of severity of disease, in implantable devices with multi-sensor monitoring capabilities; thus, it represents a useful management strategy in HF patients [Bullinga, 2005; Tsuji, 1996]. A continuous external monitoring device worn on the wrist, such as the WHOOP device, would provide valuable physiologic data for a cohort of HF patients who were previously unable to be monitored in this fashion. Secondary analysis of this study will investigate the use of intra- and post-activity HR and RR as predictors of hospitalization rates, a common problem in HF patients that correlate with worse mortality outcomes."

 "BriefSummary": "This is a phase II/III randomised, multi-centre, prospective, open label, community-based clinical trial. The trial aims to recruit patients who test positive for COVID-19 but who have mild disease and therefore can treat their symptoms in the community. Patients who seek testing and have a confirmed positive test result will be invited to enrol in the trial.",
"DetailedDescription": "Coronavirus-induced disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is a highly contagious disease with a high and unpredictable morbidity and mortality, for which there is currently no specific treatment. Progression from a mild fatigue, fever and cough, to severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation may occur 1 to 2 weeks into the disease. This provides a window of opportunity in which patients in the early phase of the disease could be treated with a disease-modifying agent, to halt disease progression, prevent hospital admissions with respiratory failure and prevent death.\n\nCamostat is a serine protease inhibitor in clinical use in Japan since 1985 to treat patients with chronic pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) and has an acceptable safety profile. Camostat has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry into epithelial cells in vitro. A trial of this repurposed drug for treatment of COVID-19 in humans is urgently required to assess its impact on disease progression to respiratory failure and whether it can reduce mortality.\n\nThe trial has a pilot phase and then a continuation phase. Patients will be randomised into a treatment arm (camostat tablets) or control arm (best supportive care). Patients will be called daily at home for 14 days by the clinical trial team to collect symptoms and record the general well-being of the patient. The primary aim of this trial is to determine if camostat can reduce the clinical progression of COVID-19 and therefore the need for hospital admission and supplemental oxygen. Secondary aims include collection of patient reported health status, severity of symptoms and biological markers of the virus. As the understanding of COVID-19 develops and improves, the inclusion criteria may be adapted to support the trial outcomes. Patients will be recruited through various settings which may include primary care 'COVID-19 hub' clinics, COVID-19 community-based testing centres or other clinical environments."

 "BriefSummary": "This randomized control trial will compare buprenorphine and morphine, two currently used medications for the treatment of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS), in newborns to determine which medication will reduce the number of days of pharmacological treatment.",
"DetailedDescription": "This randomized control trial will compare buprenorphine to morphine, two currently used medications for the treatment of NOWS, to determine whether the use of buprenorphine for NOWS treatment will reduce the number of days of pharmacological treatment. After an infant is born they will be monitored for signs of NOWS. Once an infant reaches treatment thresholds, they will be randomized using a double dummy design to either the buprenorphine or morphine treatment arm. After randomization infants will receive a syringe with either morphine or placebo every 4 hours and every 8 hours infant will receive 1 sublingual application of buprenorphine or placebo. To maintain the blind infants enrolled in the study will receive both interventions. During the study medication doses will be weaned by 10% of the stabilization dose. Study intervention will continue until 20 percent of the maximal dose has been reached. Use of a second line drug will be permissible after randomization and after an infant has had 2 consecutive escalations. Second line drug will be phenobarbital, in addition to the study drug. Infants in both groups will be evaluated and scored for NOWS symptoms to determine if weaning study medication is permissible each day. NOWS scores that do not reach the threshold for escalation will wean in accordance with standard clinical practice. If NOWS symptoms increase during treatment, infants will have the dose of the study drug increased by 10% to the previous day's dose. When stable for 24 hours, the weaning process will continue. The NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS) will be administered prior to starting study medication and once off study medication but prior to discharge to examine proportion of infants in each medication arm for the abnormal NNNS profiles which has been associated with atypical early childhood outcomes including behavior problems and low IQ scores. Development at 18 months of age will also be assessed to examine any differences in both arms of the study."

 "BriefSummary": "Previous studies showed that, best lung protective strategies of ventilation parameters are based on driving pressure in damaged lungs. But there are few studies concerning the effects of different positions during different types of surgery on driving pressure with normal lungs.So the investigators decided to compare mechanical ventilation based on driving pressure with conventional mechanical ventilation in patients with lateral decubitus position during total hip replacement surgery. The investigators hypothesised that, there will be better intraoperative hemodynamic and respiratory parameters with better early postoperative results in patients whom mechanical ventilation parameters are adjusted according to driving pressure.\n\nIn this randomised, controlled, double blind study, 60 patients who will have total hip replacement surgery will be recruited to the study. 30 patients will be ventilated by 8 ml/kg tidal volume and 5 cmH20 PEEP, in conventional lung protective group. And the other 30 patients will be ventilated by 8 ml/kg tidal volume and PEEP level with the lowest driving pressure.\n\nThe investigators primary goal in this study study is to compare the effects of conventional lung protective ventilation with ventilation based on driving pressure on hemodynamic and respiratory parameters. And secondly, the investigators aim to compare the effects of these two techniques s on early postoperative outcome. The investigators primary result parameters are intra operative fluid consumption, lactate, etC02 and mix venous oxygen saturation levels.The investigators secondary result parameters are postoperative mechanical ventilation, ICU stay and discharge times.",
"DetailedDescription": "There may be physiologic and pathologic pulmonary changes because of inflammatory cytokine release during total hip replacement surgery due to surgical invasivity or advanced age, comorbidities, perioperative immobility of patients. Also intraoperative mechanical ventilation can cause volutrauma, barotrauma or atelectrauma risk because of lateral position during hip replacement surgery. All these factors can cause pulmonary complications and vascular permeability increase in dependent and independent regions due to neutrophil response increase. Intraoperative hypovolemia is often observed in this group patients because of preoperative prolonged fasting periods, insufficient fluid intake due to preoperative delirium and depression. Also mechanical ventilation with positive pressure slightly decreases venous return to the heart resulting decrease in cardiac output. It is more obvious in the presence of hypovolemia. Providing continuous sufficient intravascular volume is necessary for prevention of tissue hypoxia and providing optimal cardiac output. It is known that intra operative hemodynamic optimisation, has positive effects on mortality ratio. But proper intravascular volume is not always easy to maintain, and it is not always easy for anaesthetists to identify deficiency or overload of intra operative intravascular volume. In recent years, intravascular volume therapies are goal directed by the reflections of respiratory mechanics on arterial pressure and pulse oximetry. Plethysmographic wave changes observed in pulse oximetry induced by positive pressure ventilation is accepted as indicator of hypovolemia. Hemodynamic changes induced by respiratory mode can be measured by invasive arterial monitorization. This dynamic variable is called as pulse pressure variation index and is correlated with amplitude changes observed in pulse oximetry signals. These variations are based on changes observed in pulse wavelength due to the changes in intrathoracic pressure. In some pulse oximetry devices, this is done as standard function as path variability index (PVI). PVI is measurement of dynamic changes of perfusion index during a whole respiratory cycle. Pulse oximetry wave length changes enables the evaluate hypovolemia noninvasively.\n\nPVI is gaining importance as a dynamic parameter in evaluating fluid treatment during surgery. Goal directed fluid therapy has shown positive effects on results on patient survival. In a study which fluid therapy was guided by PVI changes and it was reported that, goal directed fluid therapy had positive results.The investigators also, use some invasive and noninvasive monitorization techniques, including PVI and CVP, to monitor static and dynamic hemodynamic parameters during hip replacement surgery and we apply fluids according to our fluid therapy protocols. The investigators use blood gas analysis to monitor the efficiency of this treatment.\n\nIn this study, in both groups the investigators will apply fluid according to PVI values, so if any difference detected is observed between groups will be because of the differences of respiratory parameters between groups. And the investigators can detect, PVI stability and less fluid needs differences between groups.\n\nPETCO2 is, another parameter which will be evaluated in this study, is a factor of tissue CO2 production (VCO2), alveolar ventilation and cardiac output (mainly pulmonary blood flow). It is known that, when CO2 produced at the tissues and formed in lungs are constant, the changes of etCO2 are due to the blood flow differences and it is related to changes of cardiac output. For this reason, PETCO2 is suggested as a noninvasive measure for continuous assessment of cardiac output. At the same time, it is possible to comment about changes of dead space by measuring arterial CO2 pressure.\n\nDecrease of PETCO2, resulted from cardiac output decrease, can not be explained only with the decrease rate of excretion of CO2, but also can be explained by the changes of production of CO2 caused by dependency to oxygen supply. On the contrary, when cardiac output is high, pulmonary blood flow is no longer a limiting factor for PETCO2 formation, and PETCO2 is related to sufficiency of alveolar ventilation.\n\nAs a result, etCO2 measurement has some advantages; it is simple noninvasive and does not require a invasive hemodynamic measurement."

 "BriefSummary": "Propofol is often used for sedation in children undergoing magnetic resonance imaging. The investigators will perform a chart review of 4 month of activity (about 100 cases) and review the incidence and severity of adverse events of this sedation technique.",
"DetailedDescription": "Magnetic resonance imaging in children, especially under 6 years of age, is often performed under sedation. Propofol is a common drug used in this settings. In our institution, sedation is most often done by a propofol bolus of 2-5 mg/kg in order to reach a deep level of sedation as defined by Coté et al. If judged necessary by the attending anaesthesiologist, a additional propofol bolus of 0.5-1 mg/kg may be given. For longer lasting exams, the attending anaesthesiologist can chose to use a continuous infusion of propofol. The investigators will review the charts of 4 month of magnetic resonance imaging, which will give us a cohort of about 100 patients. Baseline characteristics, detailed sedation technique used will be recorded. Adverse events defined as:\n\nOxygen desaturation measured by transcutaneous oximetry SpO2=94%\nhypercapnia measure by end-tidal CO2 >45 mm Hg\nmovement of the patient\n\nAssuming a non-normal distribution (tested by a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), variables will be reported as median and interquartile range. Statistical tests will be done by non-parametric tests, Mann Whitney U. Non continuous variables will be analyzed by a Chi-square test."

 "BriefSummary": "This randomized, placebo-controlled phase III trial is evaluating the benefit of rucaparib and enzalutamide combination therapy versus enzalutamide alone for the treatment of men with prostate cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) and has become resistant to testosterone-deprivation therapy (castration-resistant). Enzalutamide helps fight prostate cancer by blocking the use of testosterone by the tumor cells for growth. Poly adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, such as rucaparib, fight prostate cancer by prevent tumor cells from repairing their DNA. Giving enzalutamide and rucaparib may make patients live longer or prevent their cancer from growing or spreading for a longer time, or both. It may also help doctors learn if a mutation in any of the homologous recombination DNA repair genes is helpful to decide which treatment is best for the patient.",
"DetailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS) with enzalutamide and rucaparib camsylate (rucaparib) versus enzalutamide alone for patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer commencing first-line therapy.\n\nII. (PK substudy) To evaluate the safety and tolerability of rucaparib and enzalutamide combination III. (Quality of life substudy) To compare quality of life as measured by FACT-P Trial Outcome Index in patients with mCRPC who receive enzalutamide plus rucaparib vs enzalutamide alone at the 12-month time point (primary QOL timepoint).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare rPFS and OS with enzalutamide and rucaparib versus enzalutamide alone within homologous-recombination repair (HRR) aberrant and wild-type patients.\n\nII. To evaluate the effects of concurrent administration of rucaparib on time to unequivocal clinical progression.\n\nIII. To evaluate the effects of concurrent administration of rucaparib on best radiographic response using Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria.\n\nIV. To evaluate the effects of concurrent administration of rucaparib on duration of overall response.\n\nV. To evaluate the effects of concurrent administration of rucaparib on prostate specific antigen (PSA) response rate.\n\nVI. To evaluate the effects of concurrent administration of rucaparib on best response by serum PSA by months 7 and 13.\n\nVII. To evaluate the effects of concurrent administration of rucaparib on time to first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE).\n\nVIII. To evaluate the effects of concurrent administration of rucaparib on safety and tolerability as measured by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria; and trial discontinuation for treatment emergent toxicities.\n\nIX. To compare performance of plasma-based and tissue-based genomic profiling in detection of homologous-recombination repair mutation (HRRm) in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nThe mandatory PK substudy will enroll up to 18 patients. These patients receive a fixed dose of enzalutamide (160mg daily) and varying doses of rucaparib in cohorts of 3 to 6 patients to find the recommended dose for the phase 3 portion.\n\nIn the randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 portion, patients will be randomized to 1 of 2 arms:\n\nARM I: Patients will receive enzalutamide orally (PO) once daily (QD) and rucaparib PO twice daily (BID). Patients who did not undergo bilateral orchiectomy will also receive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) consisting of leuprolide acetate intramuscularly (IM), goserelin acetate subcutaneously (SC) every 12 weeks or degarelix SC. Cycles will repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM II: Patients will receive enzalutamide PO QD and placebo PO BID. Patients who did not undergo bilateral orchiectomy will also receive ADT consisting of leuprolide acetate IM, goserelin acetate SC every 12 weeks or degarelix SC. Cycles will repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter the completion of study treatment, patients will be followed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years."

 "BriefSummary": "Background: An exact lymph node staging is essential in the treatment of rectal cancer.\n\nObjective: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of indigo carmine injection on the number of retrieved and positive lymph nodes after transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME).\n\nDesign: This is a retrospective, non-randomised study. Settings: This study was conducted at a tertiary hospital by a multidisciplinary team.\n\nPatients: Between 2013 and 2019, patients undergoing transanal total mesorectal excision were analysed. Patients with indigo carmine injection (intervention group) were compared to those without (control group).\n\nInterventions: Transanal total mesorectal excision was performed with or without ex vivo intra-arterial indigo carmine injection.\n\nMain Outcome Measures: The number of retrieved and positive lymph nodes was the primary outcome measure."

 "BriefSummary": "We are testing the ability of vacuum dressings to improve wound healing for patients having large hernias surgically repaired who are at risk of having wound complications. We will randomly be giving some patients having this surgery the vacuum dressing and some a standard dressing and observing how their wounds heal in hospital and at follow-up appointments.",
"DetailedDescription": "This study is a multicentre, non-inferiority clinical randomized controlled trial comparing the use of incisional negative pressure wound therapy versus standard sterile dressings in high-risk ventral hernia repairs. We will be enrolling patients undergoing elective or emergent ventral hernia repair who have risk factors for surgical wound complications and randomizing them to either receive a PREVENA incisional negative pressure wound therapy system dressing for 7 days post-operatively or a standard sterile dressing.for 2 days post-operatively. Our primary outcome will be a composite of a variety of surgical site complications including wound infection, dehiscence, seroma / hematoma formation, non-healing wound, early hernia recurrence, and fistula formation. These will be evaluated by unblinded clinical judgement of treating physicians, and blinded assessment with ultrasonography. Our secondary outcomes will include perceived difference in Quality of Life and cost-effectiveness of the intervention."

 "BriefSummary": "Cough suppression during emergence and tracheal extubation from general anaesthesia has become an important issue as part of patient safety. Cough arised from the mechanical irritation of endotracheal tube and cuff could be accompanied by various adverse effects such as laryngospasm, hypertension, tachycardia, arrhythmia and increase of intracranial, intraocular, or intra-abdominal pressure.\n\nSeveral cough-preventing strategies have been proposed for smooth emergence, such as opioids, dexmedetomidine or lidocaine. Maintenance of remifentanil infusion during emergence has been reported to be an effective method in reducing cough and cardiovascular change without delay of recovery. In previous studies, the effetive effect-site concentraions for 95% of adults (EC95) for preventing cough are a little different depending on anaestheic agent, type of surgery and sex, ranged from 2.14 to 2.94 ng/ml. However, since most of these studies are for sing lumen endotracheal tube, similar preventing effect would not be expected for double lumen tube (DLT) because of its large diameter and long length. Another problem is higher concentration of remifentanil more than 2.5 ng/ml could not guarantee the safety after extubation. The efficacy of a single IV bolus of lidocaine for the prevention of cough has been the subject of numerous trials.\n\nTherefore, combined use of lidocaine and remifentanil could effectively prevent emergence cough for DLT without the risk of high concentration of remifentanil."

 "BriefSummary": "To address the gap in access to genetic services, this study will evaluate the effectiveness of an adapted model of remote delivery of genetic services to increase the uptake of recommended genetic assessment and testing in childhood cancer survivors.",
"DetailedDescription": "As childhood cancer survivors receive care locally from PCPs, the in-home, collaborative PCP model is designed to increase access to genetic services and uptake of genetic testing in childhood cancer survivors. In this model, individual survivors can access remote telegenetic services and genetic counselors will partner with PCPs to order genetic testing.\n\nThis study comprises of a 3-arm randomized Hybrid 1 Effectiveness and Implementation study in 360 CCSS survivors to evaluate the effectiveness of our in-home, collaborative PCP model of remote telegenetic services to increase uptake of cancer genetic testing in childhood cancer survivors compared to usual care options for genetic testing.\n\nAims are as follows:\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of our in-home, collaborative PCP model of remote telegenetic services to increase uptake of genetic testing at 6 months as compared to usual care among childhood cancer survivors who meet criteria for cancer genetic testing. Our primary outcome will be a composite variable indicating whether a person had pre-test counseling or genetic testing.\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of remote videoconferencing to provide greater increase in knowledge and decrease in distress and depression as compared to remote phone services, to examine the moderators of patient outcomes with remote telegenetic services, and to estimate intervention costs and incremental cost-effectiveness of the three study arms.\n\nTo conduct a multi-stakeholder, mixed-methods process evaluation to understand patient, provider and system factors associated with uptake of counseling and testing in our adapted in-home, collaborative PCP model and facilitators and barriers to uptake to provide recommendations for future implementation."

 "BriefSummary": "In Brazil there are few published studies that study, the prevalence, symptoms and the population's knowledge about the premenstrual syndrome of women of reproductive age, and that correlate these data with the sociodemographic conditions of these women. In addition, given the complexity of the diagnosis of PMS, the prevalence of PMS in the Brazilian female population may be lower than the self-reported and published in these works, since not all women who believe they suffer from PMS fully comply with the criteria contemplated in the consensus for diagnosis of PMS. In this sense, this study aims to analyze the prevalence and intensity of frequent symptoms of PMS reported by the Brazilian female population. The information generated with this study may help to rethink behaviors to improve the health and quality of life of these women, as well as offer tools for decision making related to the need for early and effective treatment of PMS, whose disorders are associated with both the fall present and future quality of life for women, as well as all of their family, social and professional coexistence.",
"DetailedDescription": "In Brazil and Latin America there are still few published studies that study, the prevalence, symptoms and the population's knowledge about the premenstrual syndrome of women of reproductive age, and that correlate these data with the sociodemographic, socioeconomic and sociocultural conditions of these women .\n\nIn the investigator's view, this study brings value not only to contribute to the understanding and demystification of PMS by society in general, but also for the professionals who assist these women. The data currently used in Brazil, and which are frequently used to guide public health policies, are mostly the result of research carried out in other countries, and which may not correspond to the national reality.\n\nThe information generated with this study may help to rethink behaviors to improve the health and quality of life of these women, at this stage in which comprehensive attention to the health and needs of this population should be given, often providing contraceptive methods that offer, as a benefit relief of symptoms related to PMS. The data from this research may also offer tools for decision making related to the need for early and effective treatment of PMS, whose disorders are associated with both the decrease in the present and future quality of life for the woman, as well as all of her family life, social and professional."

 "BriefSummary": "A naturalistic study design, in which dTMS patients will be randomized to get a free add-on CBT treatment. The dTMS procedure will include treatment as usual, and participants will use the app from post randomization (Pre-treatment is defined as measures from the first three days of treatment) to the end of dTMS treatment (Post-treatment which is defined as measures from after twenty TMS sessions over a minimum of four weeks), and for an additional three months of FU (FU).",
"DetailedDescription": "Participants will be recruited from those attending dTMS clinics around the world (i.e.,naturalistic study design), and consenting individuals (in person consent done in the clinic on paper) will be given a random user code. This code will be specific for their version of the app, and the only link between their signature and the code will remain at the site for auditing purposes. Participants will undergo treatment as usual of dTMS and will use GGDE twice a day. Participants will be asked to complete demographic and clinical questionnaires via the GGDE app, and relevant clinical questionnaires will be re-administered following treatment and during FU. The initial and all following dTMS sessions will involve patients going through the stimulation procedure (The operator will record stimulation variables such as individual patient's intensity of stimulation and coil location into GGDE) followed by 5 min of GGDE use. The patient will indicate which statements (in that session) were most relevant and challenging to them, which will be followed by a pre-prepared psycho-education paragraph about the specific maladaptive belief addressed by the app that day. The patient will then be prompted to use the app one more time at home during the same day. Patient will continue similar use during FU, with two GGDE usage each day. The naturalistic design will allow the accumulation of large quantities of data in a short period of time, aiming to optimize GGDE using machine learning. Importantly, GGDE will allow the random allocation of users to different GGDE modules of the app (i.e., similar app versions with changes in specific parameters related to different depressive traits). One out of the ten modules used in this trial will include neutral (placebo) stimuli requiring the user to respond to plus/minus signs rather than MDD relevant statements."

 "BriefSummary": "Falls are major contributors for immobility and independency. Most falls in older adults occur during walking after a sudden unexpected loss of balance. It was well-established that balance can be improved by performance of a training program that provides perturbation (unexpected perturbations of balance). The main aim of the current study is to investigate the effects of two perturbation-training methods: 1) random perturbation training; vs. 2) block (non-random) perturbation training. We also aim to explore brain area's (as measured by MRI) that are related to balance function in older adults.\n\nWe hypothesize that response to an unexpected loss of balance is the balance responses will be improved in both training methods, but more in the random training method. We also hypothesize that brain function as seen in MRI will be improved in both training methods, more in the random training method.\n\nAs far as we know, there is a lack of studies investigating the learning effect of random vs. block non-random training on balance recovery responses while walking and exposure to unexpected loss of balance and on brain function.",
"DetailedDescription": "Goals:\n\nDetermine the relationship between gait stability (as measured in the Lab) and brain function (MRI) in 50 old (70 years old and over) and 10 young adults (20-40 years old) that represent heathy brain.\nTo determine which of the training intervention methods (25 older adults that participate in random training vs. 25 older adults that participate in block non-random training) are more beneficial for balance recovery responses and for improved brain function.\n\nMethods: This study is a clinical investigation study. First stage - Individuals that show an interest in participating in the study will be exposed to a brief interview before further testing is performed to see if they fit the inclusion-exclusion criteria. Individuals who pass the interview a screening, and physical examination and the additional questionnaires and functional tests described below.\n\nSecond stage - Testing different motor learning paradigms for improving balance recovery ability: A convenience sample of 60 healthy subjects (10 young's, 50 older adults) will be recruited. After testing their clinical balance performance (Berg balance test, 6-minutes' walk and get up and go) and cognitive function (MOCA), All testing will occur on a specific motor-driven surface perturbation treadmill (BaMPer). The Gait protocol will include about 10-20 minutes of comfortable pace walking, than progressive unexpected surface perturbations will be added. The same protocol will be performed with during standing condition. Subjects will also walk on the treadmill without perturbations. The order of the different test conditions will be randomized.\n\nOutcome measures: The stepping threshold as measured by the distance of the platform movements in centimeters will be measured. Quantitative parameters of the compensatory stepping/ and motor ability (i.e., step reaction time, step time, step length), descriptive parameters of the stepping strategy after perturbation\n\n(i.e., arm responses, upper body responses, leg step threshold and fall threshold). In addition, we will be testing the correlation between brain activity and anatomy using brain imaging in 10 young and 50 older adults and correlate with balance/motor function.\n\nThe aims of this study are to determine the relationship between the different requirements for gait stability (walking without perturbations, ability to overcome small perturbations, ability to overcome larger perturbations and, largest recoverable perturbation during walking) and brain function and anatomy. The research hypothesis: there is a correlation between the age related atrophies in areas of the brain and functional capacity\n\nThird stage - A Randomized control trial we will compare two perturbation motor learning paradigms with different challenge level of the practice condition (i.e. blocked practice vs random practice). According to motor learning theory we hypothesize that a) healthy older adults will benefit more from random practice. The purpose of this stage is to investigate the effects of task practice order (random vs blocked) on motor learning (i.e. responding to perturbations during walking) in older adults. According to motor learning theory we hypothesize that a) healthy older adults will benefit more from the random motor learning approach as compared to using blocked practice."

 "EligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\nMale or female, age at least 18 years, no more than 75 years.\nPreviously untreated, histologically documented NSCLC with completely or potentially resectable IIIA-N2 nonsquamous NSCLC(according to Version 8 of AJCC staging). N2 is defined as as radiologically and pathologically confirmed, nonbulky metastases to single-station mediastinal lymph nodes (lymph nodes < 2 cm in short axis) that are expected to be completely resectable.\nTumor tissue samples or blood samples are confirmed as EGFR sensitive mutations by central laboratory tests (including Ex19del or L858R, both alone or with other EGFR mutations). If the tumor tissue is accessible, the tumor tissue is recommended to be submitted for examination. If tumor tissue is not accessible or patient cannot undergo tissue biopsy, blood sample is also allowed.\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 with no deterioration over the previous 2 weeks and a minimum life expectancy of 12 weeks.\nAt least 1 lesion that has not previously been irradiated, that has not been chosen for biopsy during the study screening period, and that can be accurately measured at Baseline as >= 10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes, which must have short axis >= 15mm) with computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), whichever is suitable for accurately repeated measurements. If only one measurable lesion exists, it is acceptable to be used (as a target lesion) as long as it has not been previously irradiated and baseline tumour assessment scans are done at least 14days afar the screening biopsy is performed.\n\nWomen of childbearing potential must use a contraception method during the study treatment and for at least 3 months after the treatment is completed; must have a negative pregnancy test prior to starting treatment or proved no risk of pregancy by meeting one of the following criteria:\n\nPostmenopausal defined as age more than 50 years and amenorrheic for at least 12 months following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments.\nWomen under 50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more, following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments, and with luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in the postmenopausal range for the laboratory.\nDocumentation of irreversible surgical sterilization by hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy, but not by tubal ligation.\nMale patients should be willing to use barrier contraception (i.e., condoms) during the study treatment and for at least 3 months after the treatment is completed.\nSigned and dated informed consent form.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nTreatment with any of the following:\n\nPrior surgical resection of lung cancer.\nPrior treatment with any EGFR TKI.\nPrior treatment with any chemotherapy for NSCLC\nPrior treatment with any radiotherapy for NSCLC\nMajor surgery (excluding placement of vascular access) within 4 weeks of the first dose of study drug.\nMedications that are predominantly CYP3A4 strong inhibitors or inducers or sensitive substrates of CYP3A4 with a narrow therapeutic range within 7 days of the first dose of study drug.\nAny concurrent and/or other active malignancy that has required treatment within 2 years of first dose of study drug.\nAny unresolved toxicities from prior therapy greater than Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 1 at the time of starting study treatment, with the exception of alopecia and Grade 2 prior platinum-therapy related neuropathy.\nPatients with malignant pleural effusion. [only exception: pleural effusion on CT scan (not visible on CXR) or considered too small and pericardial effusion]\nPatients who received yellow-fever vaccine or other attenuated live vaccine during pemetrexed treatment.\nAny evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including uncontrolled hypertension or active bleeding diatheses, which, in the Investigator's opinion, makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial OR which would jeopardize compliance with the protocol such as active infection. Screening for chronic conditions is not required.\nRefractory nausea, vomiting, or chronic gastrointestinal diseases, inability to swallow the study drug, or previous significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate absorption of Almonertinib.\n\nAny of the following cardiac criteria:\n\nMean resting corrected QT interval (QTc) > 470 ms obtained from 3 electrocardiograms (ECGs), using the screening clinic's ECG machine and Fridericia's formula for QT interval correction (QTcF).\nAny clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction, or morphology of the resting ECG (e.g., complete left bundle branch block, third-degree heart block, second-degree heart block, PR interval > 250 ms).\nAny factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic events, such as heart failure, hypokalemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome, or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age in first degree relatives or any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT interval.\nLeft ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <= 40%.\nHistory of interstitial lung disease, drug-induced interstitial lung disease, radiation pneumonitis that required steroid treatment, or any evidence of clinically active interstitial lung disease.\n\nInadequate bone marrow reserve or organ function, as demonstrated by any of the following laboratory values:\n\nAbsolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 1.5 x 10^9 / L;\nPlatelet count <100 x 10^9 / L;\nHemoglobin < 90 g/L (<9 g/dL);\nAlanine aminotransferase > 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN).\nAspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 2.5 x ULN.\nTotal bilirubin (TBL) > 1.5 x ULN or > 3 x ULN in the presence of documented Gilbert's Syndrome (unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia).\nCreatinine > 1.5 x ULN concurrent with creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min (measured or calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation); confirmation of creatinine clearance is only required when creatinine is > 1.5 x ULN.\nWomen at breastfeeding or have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test in the 3 days prior to the start of the treatment..\nHistory of hypersensitivity to any active or inactive ingredient of Almonertinib, or to drugs with a similar chemical structure or class to Almonertinib.\nHistory of hypersensitivity to any active or inactive ingredient of Erlotinib, or to drugs with a similar chemical structure or class to Erlotinib.\nWith lactose in the tablets, patients with rare genetic disease like galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not use use erlotinib.\nPatients who are allergic to pemetrexed or any other component of the preparation, carboplatin or cisplatin.\nPatients with contraindications of pemetrexed and carboplatin or cisplatin.\nAny severe and uncontrolled ocular disease that may, in the ophthalmologist's opinion, present a specific risk to the patient's safety.\nJudgment by the Investigator that the patient should not participate in the study if the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions, and requirements.\nAny disease or condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the safety of the patient or interfere with study assessments.",

 "BriefSummary": "Heart disease is still one of the world's most important health problems, and it ranks second among the top ten causes of death among Taiwan. The main cause of death is acute coronary syndrome, and vascular stent placement is the main treatment method for acute coronary syndrome. The probability of restenosis in patients within half a year after a general stent is as high as 25% to 40%. Re-hospitalization and surgery is a big burden on patients and the country's medical costs. However, a set of convenient and accurate clinical tools to determine the prognosis of patients has not yet been developed. Miniaturized wearable devices have been the mainstream trend in medical development in recent years. ECG and heart sound analysis technology are an easy to used medical device for automatically calculating the parameters including EMAT (electromechanical activation time), S4, S4, SDI (Systolic dyssynchrony index). ECG and heart sound could evaluate the heart function, and has the potential to be an effective tools for prognosis and treatment guidelines. Heart rate variability (HRV) and Accelerationplethysmogram (APG) is also proved the predictive effect the outcome of patients.\n\nThis study is start on June 1 2020. We will enroll 400 patients who diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome and have been a heart stent surgery, and registry there medical history,routine examination and medication, ECG and heart, HRV and APG record at admission, pre-discharge and every routine return visit within I year after discharge.Patients will also wear ECG and PPG (Photoplethysmography) band ever day after discharge, and collected the longitutinal data .All subjects will be tracked the medical adverse events in 1 years after discharge, and compare the characteristic and prognosis value of between patients with and without events. Therefore, our purpose of this study is to drive an effective outcome prediction model by non-invasive device, and establish a telecare model of patient with heart stent implantation to reducing medical adverse events.",
"DetailedDescription": "This study is open, prospective study, multi-center, randomized controlled trial, unobtrusive research. This study is start on June 1 2020. We will enroll 400 patients who diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome and have been a heart stent surgery. And random allocation 200 experimental group (Non-invasive Wearable Device) and 200 control group (routine medical).\n\nAsk whether the patients who meet the exclusion criteria are willing to participate in the screening (Screening), if they are willing to join and sign the consent of the subject, and after the patient's condition is stable, conduct an electrocardiogram (V0) before discharge from the hospital. On day 7 (±2 weeks), day 84 (±4 weeks), 168 days (±4 weeks), 252 days (±4 weeks), 336 days (±8 weeks) during routine clinical referral (V1-V5) Both are done once. The results of these two tests and other basic information of the patient, including Demography, Vital Signs, High, Weight, Medication, and European and Taiwan Cardiology Association recommended routine test results of high-risk patients, including Blood Chemistry Panel, NT-proBNP, Echocardiography, Myocardial Perfusion Scan, etc., will record the information of the logged-in subjects on the paper case report form. The CRF (case report form) only displays the study number, and no subject is available. In addition to the examination of each return visit, the subjects also took the ECG bracelet home at the time of discharge (V0) and wore it every day. After the discharge, the ECG was measured every morning and evening, and their personal activity and sleep were collected. Relevant information. After the subject was discharged from the hospital, the subject tracked the date of all adverse events due to cardiovascular disease within one year, including: heart failure, restenosis due to blood vessel, and non-fatal myocardial infarction , To do blood vessel-related surgery again, and data on the occurrence of death."

"DetailedDescription": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a kind of neurodegenerative disease that affects upper and lower motor neurons. In animal model studies have shown that peripheral nerve degeneration in ALS motor function decline, tip peripheral nerve degeneration is of great significance for early progress of ALS may be, at the same time analysis showed that the motor neuron involvement severity and the prognosis of patients with ALS show obvious negative correlation, so finding biomarkers can reflect the motor neuron axonal degeneration is of great significance. Neurofilaments is an intermediate fiber specifically expressed in central and peripheral neurons and can serve as a biomarker for axonal injury, but there is no evidence now that peripheral neurofilament levels have been associated with severity of motor axonal involvement in ALS."

"DetailedDescription": "Background: Meniscus repair performed during ACL reconstruction may fail and the subsequent treatment includes revision meniscal repair or partial meniscectomy.\n\nPurpose: To retrospectively analyze the clinical outcomes of meniscus repair with simultaneous anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and explore the causes of failure of meniscus repair.\n\nMethods: From May 2013 to July 2018, the clinical data of 165 patients who were treated with meniscus surgery and simultaneous ACL reconstruction by the same doctor, including 69 cases of meniscus repair (repair group) and 96 cases of partial meniscectomy (partial meniscectomy group), were retrospectively analyzed. The 69 patients of the repair group were divided into the nonfailure group (62 cases) and the failure group (7 cases) depending on the repair effect. The average follow-up period was 38 (±10.5) months. Postoperative outcomes of the repair group and the partial meniscectomy group were compared. General conditions and postoperative outcomes of the failure group and the nonfailure group were compared. Seven patients in the failure group who underwent second arthroscopy were followed up for 30 (±17.4) months, and their postoperative outcomes were summarized."

 "BriefSummary": "This study proposes endoscopic surgery for delayed wound healing after Achilles tendon suture which is a brand new treatment,and retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 4 cases treated with this treatment. The analysis results of the clinical efficacy of the method can serve as a reference for clinical and surgical decision-making and prognosis assessment.",
"DetailedDescription": "Background: Delayed wound healing is a kind of postoperative complication of Achilles tendon suture. Conventional surgical approach is open surgery in order to clean the wound, which requires multiple dressing changes and involves a longer recovery period. We recently developed arthroscopic surgery for delayed wound healing after Achilles tendon suture. This therapy may be an alternative approach to open surgery.\n\nPurposes: In this paper we evaluate the long-term efficacy of endoscopic surgery for delayed wound healing after Achilles tendon suture.\n\nPatients and Methods: Clinical data of 4 patients with delayed wound healing after Achilles tendon suture who underwent endoscopic surgery from April 2008 to October 2017 at our institute were retrospectively analyzed. There were 3 males and 1 females with age of 39-60 years, the follow-up period was 8-43 months). All the patients had unilateral tendon rupture with 3 cases on the left and 1 cases on the right. Scores on Visual analogue scale(VAS) and the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle-Hindfoot Scale were used. The postoperative outcome was evaluated on the basis of Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment—Achilles score and Achilles tendon total rupture score (ATRS)."
